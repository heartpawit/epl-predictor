"Enough with Lacazette, play Auba down the middle and 4 in the back. Laca a waste of space and cannot take his opportunities. Every time the ball falls to him I have no confidence in him to finish",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"The information is not bad but we lack of creativity and this information can‚Äôt work with our lack of creativity.
I think Arteta need to bring Ozil back in January or he should sign another creative mild fielder.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I am still confused what the hell is happening with Gunners as I had great expectations from last match but it all shattered. If such trends keep on then we are at the verge of drowning.üòîüòîüòî,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
On Ozil Arteta got it wrong . You can't waste that gem. My team receive more beatings to pump sense to their decisions,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"There is no passion for arsenal funs!!!because again we going to lost one seoson more to get champion.!how cant see arsenal boss anf management team arteta dosent couch of arsenal..i think arsenal need to wait more years to get champion,,,!!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Another complete mess at home, giving our critics the opportunity to rant at us that it is the same arsenal with different players, but rightly so. I keep talking about the sharpness upfront and the poor mov't off the ball. But hey! It is my team, Arsenal. I hope we get over this quickly and most of all improve better. Villa just taught us what to do.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta is a tactical genius. He is amazing at his team selection. Greatest coach in the world. What place are we in? What has changed from last year when he took over. Trust the process? If this is the process then he‚Äôs gotta go.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Lame performance from an entirely average team . No determination , no team plan , no commitment , no focus . Every body is just playing to earn his income .
It will take Arsenal great time to become a great team again and competitive in EPL . You rushed to sell Martinez when Leno is so averaged .
I hate Arsenal's board under Kroenke with a passion. You killed Arsenal as you refused to strengthen the team .
Edu and co also have great blame for signing players of similarity in almost every departments . No player is assigned to do the dirty jobs even Partey that is noted for this stuff is playing the dead Arsenal's way , most unfortunate",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"What a disgraceful performance! Saka and Bellerin were weak. Holding the same. And why dont Auba play in centre? Pepe has delivered 10 mins of good play since joining the club. Laca looks done, and Nketiah still isnt close to be a player for a team that want to be, and sometimes tries to get on the upper half in PL.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arteta has decided to take out ..partey for cebalos poor very poor now there is no defence from the center ..most crosses that converted to goal came from center to left wing ..and converted to goals we are doomed at Emirates shameful..glory
to Martinez",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Clocks running low for the arsenals faithful ......... arteta and the board are making arsenal look fools again I just can‚Äôt see where arteta is taking this team I don‚Äôt understand his game plan ???? Arteta needs to pull something out this season or I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs arteta out,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Poses the questions:
1. Why is Abba playing as a winger?
2. Why is Pepe not playing? (3rd in goals/2nd in assists)
3. How is Ozil not up to it in ""footballing"" terms when we couldn't score if all 11 Villa players left the pitch ...
Absolute rubbish ... at least losing under Wnger was entertaining",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Can someone please explain how in the hell does the 5-2-3 formation good for this team?
The only thing it causes is a huge gap in midfield with no creative connection between defence and attack
- Tierny playing CB instead of LB is absoulte maddness, his crossing ability is excellent and a waste as a centre back, instead saka should play up front and replace Willian.
This formation is the reason this team does not score much in the PL!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Can we all just take a second to appreciate Elnenys resurgence under Arteta. What a player he has turned out to be. Especially with Partey along side him. Great partnership. üëèüèº,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arteta finally brings back the same team he played with in the last PL game, you can't just keep on blaming him for rotating the squad, even Klopp took 5 years to reach where Liverpool is today! And moreover just give Arteta 75 mil to bring in both Aouar and Szoboszlai and see what a havoc he creates! #COYG",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"If I am not mistaken, Arteta name his same line up as last game for the first time.

Pretty good enough. Fresh from wonderful match between City vs Liverpool, full of quick attacking and defensive masters. Hope Arsenal can do the same but score the goals pls.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"In a game like this I would of given Willock a start and leave Willian on the bench and leave out Xhaka completely, Willock has done well in the European games and deserves a chance in the league",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I lost interest in Arsenal the moment the Board started tutoring Ozil. Since then I always struggle to watch our games ... The passion is no more,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Three points please we can't afford to lose this one we must maintain our number or improve it on the league table, good luck",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Good balance team selection and a strong bench as well. We need to win to stay in touch at the top end.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willian needs to be dropped. You can't tell Pepe to work hard and win his place when Willian has not done enough to start,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I want to see PEPE,WI,AUBA,LA
CA BOOM. ALSO WANT TO SEE OUR MIDFIELDERS SCORING GOALS LIKE OTHER TEAM. 3 POINTS FOR SURE",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Finally crossing my fingers it's a 4 at the back system. We can get a more than 1 goal lead. All the best lads.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta is so naive n that will cost us dearly. .Why does he always bench Pepe n start with Willian? Hard to be n African in Europe.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Keep the winning 11.. Willian definitely drained .. all we have is a bit of experience from a tired leg. Hopefully Pepe or willock gets minutes to fight for the shirt in the second half,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This is unfair for Pepe, every time he delivers a great performance then he‚Äôs dropped to the bench irrespective of how Willian is performing",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Regardless of whether he‚Äôs in form or not, this is the type of game you pick Elneny for. Absolute engine who will hunt down our biggest threat - Grealish.
So pleased he‚Äôs finally getting the recognition he deserves.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I believe Pepe should be in the starting 11.He has been great. If we keep on benching him he will start having second thoughts and will have his mind elsewhere..,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Pepe should have start, William needs to step up, he hasn‚Äôt been aggressive enough on the ball for me. However every other players are in good shape..",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This lineup consistency means Arteta is edging to settling on his starting 11, which is great. All the best to the team. COYG!!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great squad there, let's pick the points early today, save us from 90 minutes of chest pains",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The match will start in 1:45 AM in our country.I am waiting not sleeping also I have work in the next day.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Sorry, Willian is playing like a veteran at the moment. He should be nowhere near starting. He brings nothing to the team, and offers nothing during the game.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I love Mo, bit part player, goes off on loan, comes back proves a point and now is a regular. Prime example of if you work hard enough you will get it. Reminds me a bit of Coquelin who did similar",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"3 at the back again. This makes me sick...We should go for 4 at back and start acting like a big and elite club again...It seems like we do timid with 3 at the back, to be honest...",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Unchanged squad for first time, we are going to get same result hope so",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Pepe should‚Äôve started over Willian but we get it Artetas signing given special treatment!!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Hoping for 4 goals today. Villa is a good side but arsenal is better. Going for a win,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The first time with the same team from last premier league match,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
One piece is missing... bring back Ozilüí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great line-up,this team will surely exploit villa,would have loved to see willock but I am sure Arteta has his reasons",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Chiefs lost again and I hope you guys are going to make my night please.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Holding X Gabriel solid, Elneny X Partey midfield bosses. It's 3 points in bag.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Pepe should be starting but apart from that I‚Äôm happy. C‚Äômon Arsenal!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Maybe Pepe should stop scoring/
assisting goals, because whenever he does he seems to get dropped lmao...ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£ but anyways... COYG!! üî¥‚ö™Ô∏èüí™üèª",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
This is the best squad we have had for a long time. Starting eleven is backed up with a formidable bench.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Same team for the first time, consistency is key.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Good to see he‚Äôs keeping this solid line up. Our best starting 11 for sure.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Only way this would be better if Pepe was in for willian, apart form that it is a great lineup and good to see him stick with El nenny with partey",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Good to see he kept a winning team. It‚Äôs the only way to get consistency üí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Apart for a couple positions that are debatable, this is probably our best 11 at the moment !!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Horrible team ! Lacazette and aubameyang are walking on the pitch and saka has no brain to play football !,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
No juice in this team... no creativity where 's the construction ..mentally also something missing... hey my Gunners you can do better,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
When will you guys realize Ozil did nothing for 90% of a game and certainly nothing defensively we cannot afford a luxury player like him!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Laca such a chance has to hit the Target.Otherwis
e his stay as a centre forward will be very short lived.What does he want to score.From Liverpool games he has been missing open chances.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
We don't need Williams & Laca in our squad.They are the problem facing our team We'll regret the action & face relegation if care is not taken,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We can see clearly what we do wrong on the pitch, all actions was going of the flank, so, atacking midfelder needed in our game, to play more in midle, to atack in that zone, If we play with Willock or Ozil like a 10, we can be more dengerous!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Seems like a good team selection, my only concern would be Willian and the fact that we have some really exciting young players that can‚Äôt seem to make the bench, let‚Äôs hope for a great game",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We miss ozil no creativity , aubameyang not interested playing on the right , you watch all the training videos they post everytime and ozil is training with the first teams and the one making the final passes for a finish but he can't play in any squad ü•¥ü§®",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"That is our strongest team at the moment, love it! Come on Arsenal! üí™",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta is right to maintain this team once again... Lets see if we gonna keep it up... Lets go gunners üí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Why does nketiah always make the bench he contributes nothing better to put willock or at least Cedric it's so frustrating,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"THE ARSENAL ATTACK IS COMPLETELY DEAD, NO FORCE, NO QUICK REACTIONS NO GOOD MOVE, NO GOOD ATTEMPT, PLAYING LIKE PRIMARY SCHOOL PLAYERS, ATETA NEED TO DO A VERY SERIOUS WORK ON THAT ATTACK, BECAUSE WITH THIS THE TEAM CAN NOT GO ANYWHERE..",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willian keeps on playing shiet but gets the nod...only player that seems undropable under mikel...swear if Mari doesn't play b4 January then definitely ozil omission wasn't arteta's decision,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
So why did we really Get Ceballos back on Loan??!!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
We need Ozil back on the team. No creativity at all.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The link between Partey and Elneny is working they can be able to stop Grealish since they were able to boss Pogba and Fred in the middle of the park and Gabriel a magnificent signing but the boys will win today our defense has improved this season just make sure the boys take one a game at a time and play the Arsenal way,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We need to change our style of football in order to achieve better results auba is a center forward,willian
is a free role midfielder nd wee need to be consistent",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I trust this kind of team selection from our own Mikel and happy to see a consistency in that . We gonna win the game,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
You lost today.. you better bring back Ozil.. This team is so annoying,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willian should do something reasonable tonight!! he has been a liability,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arteta‚Äôs selection and substitutions are very poor. What is Saka doing on the pitch. Elneny is not up to his game and instead of taking him off, he rather takes of Partey. Willian is performing well and Saka is not but he chooses to substitute Willian rather. Poor substitutionsüò°",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I hate to see Auba on the wing, Ceballos and Pepe on the bench. Arteta has got players to win games but he keeps using the attackers on the wrong positions. I just hope we win and not settle for a draw",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great line-up,but Pepe is the best over Willam.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Not a team! Never been a team! Got a few results by chance, and I'm glad the true Arsenal is showing up! Awful or do I say woeful....",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"The arsenal forward lacks consistency. Stick with
Auba, laca and Pepe game in game out.
Mid table team we should always use 3:4:3.. it will give the team the balance in the mid.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Absolutely rubbish this format of back passing doesn't work against small teams,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Very good this is the first team selection for us moving forward üí™üí™üí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
There is 3 kind of results in football...but today we need only one of them....that's wins only!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Genuinely one of the most inept performances I‚Äôve seen from an Arsenal team, the players just seem to care, they thought they just had to turn up after winning at Utd.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Our strikers should be much more lethal, while attacking for us to gain the 3 points.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
So happy to finally xhaka on the bench. Hope el nenny can maintain the same form like last week,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Should have put Runarsson in for Leno to give Leno a break because this team isn‚Äôt as good of a opponent and can‚Äôt always have the same goalkeeper every game they get tired just like every other player,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"PL needs one 11 squad, experiencing players happens during pre-season.
This kind kills the morale of players and we will never get a result.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"With a performance like this top 4 will be unachievable. The whole team was poor to say the least. If you can't beat Aston villa, it leave much to be desired. Disgusting!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Again conceding an early goal...We need to win...Come on guys...35 minutes have passed...It would have been 2-0..Please ensure 3 points...,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I‚Äôm quiet happy with this line up tbf would have been nice to see willock at least among the subs but come on arsenal 3 points please,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Saliba cant make the bench. A towering 1.90m fast defender that commited almost no fouls in french league. That boy can make our defence unbreakable if only arteta could see.training means nothing game day saliba can step up,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Apart from 2 assist in fulham game, Willian was excess baggage in the field. Cause he lost the ball twice and didnt win it back started our misery today's game.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This team is a real joke, no creativity, poor defense and mikel has more to learn, the team needs a real manager, Poch is available",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Tierney needs to play as the LWB not saka needs to be pushed further forward,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Better to use ceballose instead of lacazette, to improve creativity.
Then the formation should be 3_4_1_2, auba and pepe at the front.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This is our time to shine, this is the best line up so far ever since.... Please Mr. Arteta stick to it. Another 3 points to take",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
No need to change the winning Team that beat Man united...This lineups is Great.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Best team possible üî•
For those who criticize shut up once and for all ... False supporters ... Are you a manager? Arteta knows better than you. He does a great job. He brought in two great players Gabriel and Partey. He had the courage to kick out the parasites for the sake of the team. The team has become solid and it's getting better offensively even though there is still work to be done. A little patience, we are not on a game console ...

Go gunners!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Better from Arteta, same 11... Let's build the cohesion...",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Before we jubilate , remember this team Aston Villa smashed Liverpool 7 Goals .So don't underestimate it.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
We losing you mean its 0-1 half time we have no creation..... We missing a man he is home he have no invite to come.. #bringbackozil,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Anyone else think that the current formation is compromising the talents of the best players to accommodate guys that are not performing? It has been four league games since we scored from open play while losing two homes games in a row is not acceptable.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
It's a big mistake to all the entire team which was done in goalkeeping since from the time you decided to offload matinenze.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Fake lineups, willian, Lac and Ceballos they should not start at all!
Nile, Nketiah and Thomas, Holding is also very weak!!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Where is Ozil for heaven's sake?,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Coming here when we are already 1 nil down. Willian doesn't offer much. I hope he improves,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"The board playing politics with our best creative midfielder is bad , if they know they wanted to do this, then they should have brought money out for auora....",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Not comfortable with Willian pick though.. Willock better,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Stupid line up. Its fact. Boring boring arsenal. Mr arteta. Dont you see arsenal need AM. Where do you your mind???? Just sell auba, laza, william and also elneny. Just a bus passengers. Bring back ozil. Boring boring arsenal never change",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Consistency in team selection.... Nice!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"As funs we must accept the either three outcomes of the game,,,loose,wi
n or draw buh it's painfull when ours lose",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"When Saka can't play well, we hv no chances... The team is relying on 19yr old boy... The 19yr old boy is only the good player in the team ü§£ü§£
Where is the authority or fans who told William is the very good transfer for Arsenal??? If William is good enough to play in EPL, Chelsea won't bring Werner or Ziyech to EPL ü§£ü§£
Where is the one who pays 72Millions for Pepe??
Where is the one who told Laca is better than Giroud??
Where is the one who let Ramsey out and Thomas is like Vieira ü§£ü§£
Where is the one who tell Arteta is very good Coach??
No plan , No changes while losing....
Dont tell Villa has used money ü§£ü§£
Arteta is using the striker who has not played well in Championship ü§£
See how Wattkin plays, See Grealish plays... And also see Nkietia and Laca play, William and Pepe play ü§£ü§£
So funny
Arsenal is just the team that show disrespect to the fans",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Araenal has a small team mentality with Arteta. They play to not lose instead of playing to win!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"They scored as in 49 seconds and VAR saved us ...
Rescored us because of Holding .. He couldn't move to the guy before his pass for agoal
What a mess of tonight ... And am seeing they have dug a hole at right back of us",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Way to go,,we dont change a winning team
But
Let's try to create clear cut chances,, that's been the main problem",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"..And ELNENY is the melon you're avoiding to mention, the cause of the current turn of events, the failure we're facing now..but no one sees nor notices.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I expect the same level of commitment they displayed against a mediocrity team by the name of Man United,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great team selection. This is a sure win with at least a 3 goal difference, let's show Martinez some love with the goals üí™üí™üí™",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Small village park elneny can't boss
And is like party over for Thomas",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Just play Aubameyang central and see how we win every match.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
This is our best line up but I prefer Lacazette to come from the bench and Auba as our Number 9 Saka and Willian on the wings,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Willian is a tourist at Emirates stadium, not a player... he is the cause of the Villa goal. Easily loses the ball and has a very low work rate off the ball",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"What was that.. !!!! biggest waste of ¬£15 pay per view, villa at home! Disgraceful",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
That is the truth bro. Because of China politics but the club is losing its value at moment and it will continue.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Even when Pepe hasn't been top notch, he's still miles ahead of Willian. Pepe enjoy the bench man.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"How do you expect pepe to be consistent, when he doesn't get playing time, willian offers nothing, but yet you keep playing him, just because you the one that sign him. YOU are just ruining him",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
If saka is starting games and you can see his a talent why did we waste 72m on Pepe. Unai emery may God burn you in hell.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Mo elneny is back...and his really living up to expectations. ..... there's so many game to play this season .....xhaka should rest a lot...so when his called upon...he will give 100%,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Well balanced line up. I would prefer Pepe to start instead of Willian. Sure Pepe will come on at some point.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
But willian is not fit to start for our team,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"So Ozil was pushed to give way to hardworking people like William , this team is a clown ,Arteta out",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Villa wins 2-1. Second consecutive home defeat...Poor performance from the Gunners.. 4 Wins 4 Losses so far. Sad.
Pepe is overrated. Laca is not good enough.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Damaging.arteta
I urge you to seek coaching elsewhere.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
This line up got absolutely slated last week! And now everyone's rimming it üòè hopefully they put in a similar performance and we come out on top,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
This log called willian is like the electoral college vote of Nevada.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The entire offense could be built around Pepe and Auba crashing in from the wings... I'm guessing Arteta thinks they will be so compact Willian is required to break them down but that's kindof old school thinking at this point.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
All boys playing very hard for the team... This Blady Laca is waiting their hardworking efforts.....,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The reason why Arteta starts Willian and not Pepe is beyond me!!ü§îü§îü§î,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We're winning this, let's go for it sons.
#COYG",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
So where are all the people now that were freaking out about win over Man U and were laughing when I said this is only one game and that this tactic is not for the whole season and Arsenal won't be winning? Tactic needs to be changed and this tactic only be used for 5-10 matches per season,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Well done arteta you listened to us and social media...Elninny
and partey together companionship will be good.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Apart from the absence of Luiz, looks a solid line up.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I will never understand the math of playing Aubamayeng and Saka on the same wing. It's like playing one man less. Willian is a scam and even more lazy than Mesut √ñzil on the pitch, poor dribbles and less of a threat.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Players should at all times move forward not back passing for what.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Let's go get our 3points. Boys, keep an eye on Grealish, don't give him space like u gave Vardy.
Best wishes for the night lads.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
i always say aubemayang is not a winger arteta is a big fool we are struggling to score because our no 9 is being played on the flanks almost every team nowadays knows that when aubemayang is on the left flank he Will try to cut to the right then try to score so it is easy to mark him,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
How do we score with this poor approach.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Hoping Laca brings some form of confidence or belief in his own abilities. Otherwise he will be a liability,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Good line up, but my only problem is lacazette. I should have prefer aubameyang as the main striker, willock and William behind him .",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arsenal needs the creativity of Ozil, to lose to Villa at home it's so uncalled for.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
And it ended in Premium Tears....,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Aubameyang should be central striker! Sick of seeing him crossing it into the box when he should be in the box. Take Lacazette off and bring on Ceballos, Willian off and bring on Pepe if Willian keeps playing like this.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"COYG...Please play to win.. may all of you play as a team tonight.. ,so play smart...and today we want you create scoring target at AV goalmouth.

..",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
My only problem is playing Auba at the flanks. Nevertheless we are winning. COYG,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I thought willian would get a break to catch his breath pepe could hv started
Mo elneny starting is very good.
Cmon gunners lets get the 3 pts",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Ok... Something like Arteta has the winning formula ...he just don't want to use it.... I'm not feeling bad at all we are loosing the game...üò§üò§üò†,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willock for Pepe on the bench. He deserves the chance for PL game time. Pepe has not been able to play a final ball longer than 10ft all season,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Williams is a waste and we lack creative midfielder so always expect nothing from Aubumeyang and Laca,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
For the first time Arteta has found his team. kept the same lineup and formation,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta did not tinker with the lineup from last week. Nketiah is not a replacement for Laca. He is for youth teams.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Firs time Arteta repeat line up... It means Arsenal's will lose ü§ûüòèü§î,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3

Problem is Villa's first 11 have to be near perfect. Attacking threat minimal off the bench. The only tactical change it allows is to protect a lead by bringing in Nakamba. That is worrisome.

Our bench is nowhere near good enough. First 11 is a solid mid table side easily but our bench is so poor no real game changers on there at all. Apart from Hourihane with his set piece skills nobody can effect the game. That‚Äôs going to be our problem this season. If our first 11 aren‚Äôt doing well we will loose the game (last two games are a prime example) still think we will finish around 13th due to that reason,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Away,3

We were knocked off the perch of elitism and for years, we hoped, trusted the process and sank to mediocrity. Today we are a proper mid-table team with a collection of inconsistent misfits who play every game as if it were the first time they met each other. This is utter garbage. Perhaps Arteta is making do with what he has, perhaps he is not good enough. However one thing that is glaringly obvious is that since Dein left, Arsenal has sucked at doing business and that isn't a coincidence. Change must happen but the board must be part of that change.

The implications this year of the current status of tournaments is crazy. IF City win Champions and God forbid IF United win Europa then that opens up more opportunities below the top 4 to play in Europe next year and can you imagine the craziness if Chelsea finish in the top 4 but also win FA. This season is not over for us in the Premier league if we can put together a very strong finish. We have 21 points available, we play Everton and Chelsea, many teams above us play each other. If we could finish 6th I bet we would be in Europe and with the craziness, 7th May even get you in, at least a play in maybe. I think if we can finish with 60-65+ points we have a good shot at Europe. All this being said, I am very happy to see this attacking 4.

"Traore is a bit lightweight and not up to speed with the premier league,has some nice skills though.",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Trez will be back in for the tough games where we need to defend more. Against sides like Southampton we need to attack and that‚Äôs what Traor√© was brought for.,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Wise words - Traore ain‚Äôt the player we think he is
Trez should keep his place on current performance - just needs some luck with finishing - their goalie was outstanding as it happens",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Well he actually proved his worth when he came on, he changed the game !!",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
One of Southampton‚Äôs players continued playing after having falling on his head. I still don‚Äôt know how Traore injured himself and I‚Äôve seen it several times.,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
You were advised to rotate your first 11. This team was studied since the victory over Liverpool.,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"COYL, aswell as Trez has been playing, good to see genuine competition for places, can only be a positive, every man fighting for a shirt, there to be won, VTID ‚öΩ",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Got to give Traore a start some time and Deano clearly thinks he‚Äôs ready based on his performances in training. In Deano we trust. COYL ü¶Å,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Trez is a great player but has been a little lost on the wing, so changing it up isn't a bad thing and breeds competition which is a good thing for these players",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Trez clearly offers a great engine, particularly in protecting the FB but didn't have the best of games against Leeds as they exploited the space out wide. Happy that Traore gets a chance but hoping he'll offer the same energy in tracking back.",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Great decision

It's not about a bad reflection on trez. If you see it like that your not thinking straight.

Healthy competition is a great thing.

Both very good players",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Trez has played well , very much looking forward to seeing this lad bomb forward .

It won‚Äôt be easy today , the saints are good going forward.
Let‚Äôs lead from the front lads , attack attack attack . üëçüëä",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
We have done well so far we must gut our defensive mistakes and go for a win but always respect ‚úä your opposition!,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Trez has been playing well, will be good to see Traore, but I think Trez should've started. In Deano we trust. UTV.",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Should be starting Trez as hes a work horse and chases everything down. Southampton will press high and we will need our wingers to track back. I cant see Traore doing that üò¨,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Ha! If Traore doesn‚Äôt perform better be prepared to lose his place back to Trez.. or even AEG!,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Agree on some performances it‚Äôs harsh but Tbf cash was overloaded against Leeds & Trez supposed to be that side that said not sure Traore will track back as much but will offer more goin forward,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"It's great to see how far Trez has come, when all the comments on here are stating its harsh for him to be dropped. Last season they were all saying the opposite!",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Yea think traore will give us a better option than trez
Think it‚Äôll be another tough game today but hopefully we will come out on top
Utv",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Pleased for Traore - and Trez will have a point to make when he comes on!,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"This is our strongest 11. Saints are a strong squad, playing well, would be happy with a point and bounce back performance.",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Think Trez needs a rest, worked his socks off in pretty much every game he's featured in so far... Sure he'll be gutted, but important to keep him fit for the whole season. I love the competition for places right now",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Sound team but if we play the same formation we did against Leeds we are going to struggle again down the right, cash was caught two against one for a fare part of the match, so traore has his work cut out for him..

Personally I'd go fro a 4-4-1-1, help upfront for Oily and enough in midfield to help out on the flanks",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Wow Trez is benched for Traore!!! Interesting to see, but must be harsh on Trez. Hopefully he won‚Äôt feel disappointed to be benched after his great performance with the team!",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Don‚Äôt agree with putting Traore in for Trez, we didn‚Äôt get the best out of Trez in his first season due to the in and out nature of his selection, he performed best after a run. Proof will be in the pudding I guess.",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"I have been so excited to see Traore in this line up, teams are struggling against us now that we have Barkley, as they can‚Äôt just double up on Jack and watch us struggle. But with Traores pace and creativity as well, and Watkins being so good at holding the ball up and his runs off the ball creating space, those three could be brilliant together. I like Trez, and he‚Äôs a big reason we stayed up last year with his form in the last 4/5 games, but Traore is in a different league. Jack and Barkley can run this game, with Traore and Watkins stretching the defence. Add in the fact that Mcginn and Luiz are both good from range, and excellent passers, but both protect the defence so well this really does have the makings of a real quality side. UTV!",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Don‚Äôt mean to be negative but Traore is just one of those players you know is a complete dud before he‚Äôs even kicked a ball. Hasn‚Äôt been great in his cameos and doesn‚Äôt seem to have any work rate. Apart from that I‚Äôm positive üòÅ,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
A bit harsh on Trez. But hopeful for a great start for Traore. UTV,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Harsh on Trez, his work rate has been phenomenal this season. Gotta see what Traore offers but will need to poor a shift in too - this team ain't carrying players this season",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Not sure this is the right game for his first start in league, Southampton will be pressing us all game. You won‚Äôt get a 3rd/4th touch in the middle of the park and need good work rate today. Needs to stand up and be counted, hope he‚Äôs up for it üí™",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Can easily adapt to 4-3-3, 4-5-1 or 4-4-2 if needed. Good to mix it up a bit and see what Traore can do from the off. UTV!",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Good news! Definitely need to see what he can do. Can his skill make up for Trezeguet effort?,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Feeling nervous Southampton are a good side but come on you villa boys!!,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Trezeguet is a lot better than them. He plays hard and supports defensively as well ü§î,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Harsh on Trezeguet this is. He‚Äôs worked hard and has deserved his place in the team so to get dropped after we got dealt with by Leeds then that could have been half the team! Lets see if Traore is going to put a shift in...,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Trez has been decent, but excited to see Traore get a start.
Hopefully helps Cash out on the right hand side as Leeds massively exposed him before",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Will be interesting to see how he does my concern is his defensive work can see Cashy getting isolated today we're Trez has been good tracking back,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"As always the South African Villans are behind you,LETS GO LADS!üíúüíô",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Strong team! We need the midfielders to give more support defensively to the back four! 3 points today lads üí™üèæ,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Southampton are playing well and winning games,. Today‚Äôs going to be a tough game, but all of a sudden, what a squad we are building, from academy too 1st team",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
I think we can get back to winning ways today I'm delighted traore is starting let's hope he can do a good jobüëç,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Unlucky for Trez as he works so hard but he lacks slightly in quality imo. Hopefully smith sees something more in Traore that will improve us ü§û,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Feel a bit sorry for Trezeguet being dropped after one bad game, but it's the change I've been expecting at some point",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Our strongest line up! Lets see what it can do!

Only 1 change id 100% make is guilbert on bench for elmo and let him go instead, not getting any younger or better.",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Personally Trez gives away too many fouls for me, might not be intentional, but be good to see what traore got in his locker",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"good choice! I love trez but we need to see what Traore can do. Southampton are a great test. We have 38 matches in a season, need to see the depth we can bring",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Hopefully Traore will work as hard as Trez does tracking back to help out in defence..,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Interested to see what Traore can do. I've not been overly impressed by his cameo performances, considering the price we paid but maybe a proper Premier League start might do him some good.",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Unlucky for Trez but good to see what Traore can do. UTV üíúüíô,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Trez unlucky, but keen to see what Traore does as a starter",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"People saying it hard on trez, yes it is, but he hasn‚Äôt had any end product recent. He works hard and has definitely improved. I would rather someone on the wing who provides more of a threat though.",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Harsh on trez...think his defensive work has helped cash massively in the first few games!!....good
luck traore tho üôèüèª",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
I haven't seen a thing yet from Traore to suggest he's going to produce anything at this level! Doesn't look hungry and looks awkward and predictable when I've seen him play! Maybe there's a reason he was frozen out at lyon and the fans were delighted we took him,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
4 - 1 The Villa! I can smell the top of the league and it‚Äôs JUST over the next hill!,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Personally I would have liked to see 4411, with Elmo on rhs or midfield and jack and Ross switching behind Ollie",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
It's a good team but the bench is weak I feel.,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
No top strikers on bench need back up in next transfer window up the villa,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
i love Trez as i think most people do now but you need to use the whole squad and he did struggle last game .,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"The trez defending job will miss you today .
Tr√®z d√©fends attack 90 minutes non stop",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Think we needed a dm today possibly Nakamba to combat a much more pacey well drilled side,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Shame for Trez, but he's a very useful player as animpact sub. let's see what Traore can do as a starter! üíúüíô",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Just work hard ..tough game but take chances..hoping
Traore steps up..",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
For me Luiz has an amazing engine. He does all the ugly work that don't get recognised. Been brilliant for the villa.,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Looks a strong starting 11. Can hopefully stretch Southampton.,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Conor Hourihane should be starting. He can score from set pieces.,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
good luck lads. hoping for 3 points today. go get 'em!!,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Poor trezeguet he‚Äôs been playing so well lately and has been dropped üôÑ,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1

Come on guys we can do it,let's finish the season great and get the whole 3 points.
I have faith in your abilities.
Up Chelsea for life
I love Chelsea",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Everything comes down to this. The season has been a rollercoaster but since TT took over the wheel the team has shown their true self and the confidence has been high.
Fantastic character shown by everyone and also many thanks to Frank Lampard for everything he has done from the start of the season.
Lets stand by the boys and show them the love they surely deserve for this season.
COME ON CHELSEA!! üëèüèºüíô",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Possibly the strongest squad we can have out there today. It's only sad that we don't even have Tammy included on the bench! I think this is only a disrespect to Tammy but, a complete devaluation of his contributions. Tuchel may be doing good but his treatment of Tammy is unjustifiable",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"A win for our last match
C'mon blues",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1

Hopefully Werner learns to stay onside and score real goals. A win is sure here. #COYB,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Hope General Kant√© will be ready for the UCL final on May 29th.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1

I have a feeling Tammy is gonna turn into those players we regret neglecting,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Why does Timo Werner has to be in the starting line up but yet still he's not in a good form.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Come on we wasted to much of chances. Mount don't be too selfish. Atleast pass a teammate who are in better position.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"So there isn‚Äôt a player who can play captain aziplicueta position,so he can rest.Ds guy have played consistently,I have lost count,he‚Äôs a gem.Hope we win ds match so we cement our third position .",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Too much passing across at the back. We need the ball up where our three fast men are. Werner is useless again! Come on Chelsea!!,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Fantastic line up. Give us this day Chelsea and seal the top four position. Up Blueeeeeeeeeees

"We want to, and will, win this game. But even if we don't, TT has been great. From 10th position in December, now we are sitting 3rd and in 2 major finals ... üí™. Give him another 2 years contract extension, and he will do more wonders. KTBFFH! üíôüíôüíô",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1

It's a win for blues. All the best family. üíôüíô,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Captain America is having a difficult game he should be subbed at the break. Otherwise our problem still remains the same, finding it hard to score.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Werner is only good against a high line oppositions, otherwise he'll run the whole game without any impact",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"When the world pushes us to our knees,Chelsea are always in the best position to pray.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"I'd have loved to see Ziyech instead of Pulisic, maybe see Captain America in 2nd half. Love the line up though. #COYB",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Very disappointing, we need to depend on other games results to be qualified for UCL",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Abraham continues to miss out on match days, sad,anyway great line up, come on Chelsea let's finish on a high",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
This is now the best team in London...Beat those lads to death,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"That's a great lineup, let's just be focused without losing concentration especially on Grealish and Watkin. Good luck guys, c'mon KTBFFH",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
This is a strong lineup! We can easily win if without personal errors.. go Chelsea! üòò,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1

"We win together, we lose together, Chelsea for LIFE! COYB!",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
This is also going to be the line up for the champions League final. Come on you blues.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"big hole left with Kante out, gonna need a big match from Kovacic today",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Tuchel ain't joking today. Let's go lads good line up now finish the job.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"It's the best we have, apart from a reliable striker and Kant√©. I'm worried he won't make it next week and that will be devastating to our Champions League hopes. But now let's focus on being on that competition next season, c'mon Blues!",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Such a poor first half Werner is offering nothing And Pulisic is non existent Jorginho is so poor don‚Äôt understand how he gets in team they will regret not having Tammy in the team he will move on,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"We are back to Europa. With Werner missing chances . Look , Werner doesn't even catch refs attention much even if he's fouled apart from last game where he won just one penalty. Let's not rely on fouls but clinical finishes.
If he doesn't perform well he should be subbed immedieately.
üíôüíô Fan",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"So many of you complained about Tammy , if Tammy on the lineup and Chelsea lose then you all going to blame the manager ü§î let the coach do his Job .",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Let's finish strong to send the message for next season.. Come on you blues..,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Now where is Tammy? This TT is good but I'm starting to hate him for how he as treated Tammy that he can't even feature at the bench. That boy grew from our academy and he deserves better treatment. He has a talent in him,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
No Kante no Tammy. Something tells me Kante rested for the final and we'll never see Tammy in a Chelsea shirt again,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
It is always sad for the last game of the season. Miss the games but I guess in America I can watch teams here. Just not the same. I am sure the teams are exhausted after almost no break after last season. Cheering from America. Go Blues!,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"I just want to be objective. I don't want anyone bashing TT if we don't get the result today. The man has really done good in reviving our boys and the season.

Let it be on record that Lampard put us in this difficult situation and TT came to bail us out.

I don't want to hear TT out if something goes south .",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Why does he always play werner, the offside king üôà",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Today all that matters is getting the job done....get it over with early 1st half and then manage the game....the team we believe can get the job done. Go go Chelsea,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"My combination is starting today... kovacic, pulisic and mount!! We are going to win this game no doubt",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Just need that FAST AND FURIOUS type of football played on Tuesday,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
We don't care about playing good today... Just win üôè,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Lets bring Aur√©lien Tchouam√©ni from Monaco great passer of the ball short and long range, great vision, one of the best tacler in Europe and he is still only 21.
If we are to compete with Man City for the Title we need another superhuman in the team.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Hope we can score more than 1 goal our goals per game is not good abraham should have started,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"There is no time for joke. It is as crucial as winning champions league final.

Good luck",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Good luck to the Blues hopefully there'll be no serious injuries we need the whole army in the final,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Tuchel should think otherwise about Jorginho come next season.
Azpili today let his temper an frustrations rule him.
We lose yes but thanks to our little brother across London Totte we now got a guarantee in ucl next season.
But this thick headed lastborn brother (Crystal)... !!! We're going to call a disciplinary committee to find out the best way to punish himüòÇüòÇüòÇ",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Beyond words get a proven bloody goal scorer on it's not bloody rocket science KTBFFH.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Good to see and Christensen back before our match against city,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Just thinking Werner come into game as fans ?he had to take defence responsibility for corner also.. just hope Mr TT wont regret of his decision,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
I hope kante is back for next Saturday because Kova is miles away from match fitness,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"What I'm thinking is that Tuchel should ones again switch Azpi and James in the UCLFinal.James just gives us that attacking threat to kill the City defense.Theres alot of talk about the ""wall"" that Ruben Diaz is but this season Chelsea have beaton them twice with Diaz.We're good anough to win itüí™‚öΩ",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Have a feeling Werners due a change of luck , he‚Äôs going to have a game soon where it all goes right for him",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Why are they playing like they don't want to win?? Astonvilla now on lead,... Chelsea should be serious on striking and Kavocic to avoid this dribble so much, H",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Injustice has been done to Abraham, I feel Werner should be benched and Abraham given a chance",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
I have created ahatred on Tuchel because of the way he treated Abraham it really hurts me so much..... how can u give more than ten league matches and scores two goals but still your trusting him...I magine Abraham hasn't been playing since Tuchel took over but he has the same goals in league as those ones of Werner who's playing every league game..... it's so unfair!!!!!! Maybe he also supports his county men.....,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
This team should get the job done. No wasting of chances.. let's put the record straight to avoid playing under pressure.. good luck the blue boys,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Come on Chelsea this is the game to define our season we must win for the betterment of our top four and build the confidence for the champions league final üíê,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"This is a must-win match for us, I hope the boys are well braced for the match ahead. #KTBFFH",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Perhaps Werner could time his runs on this final match...too many offside goals to his name,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Hope Tuchel will be able to explain why he decided Abraham is not good enough to play for Chelsea,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"We need to change the Captain - a disgrace . How many chances do we need per goal ? must be a world - record . We can‚Äôt win the ECL final on this performance so roll on next season. 2 points per game average under the new manager in the PL is a start but losing against West Brom , Arsenal and Villa is embarrassing",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Come on Blues...... 3‚É£ goals won't be bad,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"As a Chelsea fun all I'd say is all the best Totenham.Regard
less of Chelsea's results today may Tottenham get nothing but a win.That way we are sure of top 4",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Whenever Jorginho is on we must expect the negative performance,,
He caused our Chelsea too much by his errors,,, Sarri‚Äôs spoiled boy left behind to continue the mess...",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
No Tammy again for sure Tuchel cant understand the real value of someone until that person is a memory chelsea is not in safe hands.remember tammy is our top goal scorer,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Giroud has to get a run out at some point as it could be his last PL game for Chelsea,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Play to score...play to win..we don't care the style but we put our mind in a win...best wishes,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Come on boys ,it's in our hands",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Dat thiago, mount,Jorginho,
rudigier and Azipli they are going to get Tuchel sacked trust me... No fighting jus screen shot for Incase his job last longer",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
We must not take this game like a pinch of salt. It is the first of two final ....let's win and make a statement .....against the main final against city next week ... We are winning This üíØ,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"I don't like the position James is playing this period, because it's quite frustrating to see captain up right wing without anything to show it. TT is making think he's blind",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"I love Werner, but replace him please in this match. Todays play clearly involves crossings, which is Girouds speciliaty.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"With Mendy as our first man, 3 points for grabs is rest assured.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"I have said it before. This coach is going nowhere. After yesterday‚Äôs match at Villa Park, one wonders what city will do to this team.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"One mistake though,keeping giroud on the bench...hope he makes it to ucl final starting xi",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
We are lucky don't disappoint in ucl,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Have come to realize the stronger the squad the higher chances of losing,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Come on blues victory is ours KTBFFH,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
What happened to Tammy Abraham? No Kante sef. We'll just win even if it requires throwing ball inside net with your hand go ahead,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"All the players are not performing, especially our Player of the season who can't shoot accurately",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Oy vey... So frustrating, had to turn the game off. Apparently, they don't want it bad enough. Watching a different game now! ü§®",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"No mercy lineup... If we lose, it's a genuine loss not ma mistakes in lineup.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Hudson and giroud are needed for this one. In tuchel we trust though,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Now that most players are fit, the only place that Tammy could have a chance is in for Giroud as Timo and Kai can also play as no. 9. No reason for both Giroud and Tammy to be on the bench",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
We need a striker .... because if not for Tottenham it could have ended in sorrow today...,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Our forwards lack finishing, so to me we don't deserve champions league next season",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Ziyech and Harverts should have started the game I think T. T. is starting to lose it now yes Timo Werner do assist but come on,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Can we throw away Timo Werner away already? What kind of Striker is this?,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"I think CFC management need to learn from lessons passed.
No snowflake strikers from EU ......(Torres and Werner)
Find a Drogba please üôèüôèüôèüôè",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
getting sick of seeing Timo in the starting lineups... bench him please.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Honesty, it's a big insult to play more than ten matches without starting neither Olivia nor Tammy considering the constant misses of Timo üòûüòûüòûüòûüòû",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"How do we have kovacic in the game without Hudson odoi or or Ziyech...
Let's pray kovacic goes to Madrid soon",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
All the way Chelsea...#Come on blues,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Good decision not to risk Kante, we need him next week. This team is good enough to get the job done. Come on You Blues.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
On my opinion Azip should be on the bench now he plays nothing honestly Christiansen should take his position,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Kovacic almost gave away the same goal like the one against leicester. And the forward line is crapped. Conceding yet again before half time.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Nervous üò¨ I just know they gonna Chuck in a woeful performance like we did against arsenal just before a final. Just get it done ffs!!,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Pulisic can‚Äôt start ahead of Kai in the UCL final. The guy brings nothing to the team. Azpi don‚Äôt offer anything playing as a wing back.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Werner is the worst player on the team. He chokes time and time again. Havertz should have started instead!!,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
It seems Werner has shares with Chelsea even at his worse form still in the game,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"All over Leicester lost.. we are in top 4, doesn't matter if we lose this game..lol üòÑ",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Great lineup sure win for us come on guys
Blue is the colour",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
We are not joking with this lineup..bring it...Blues all the way. #Chelsea,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Come on you Blues! I‚Äôll take a scrappy 1-0 win, but I need a win!",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Where is Kante?,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Yes. This is our best. We should finish the game in first half.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
I don't know why the manager doesn't play zouma or Christiansen for fear games like this & possibly retain his best for UCL final... Giroud could hv start instead of that imbecile werner,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"I can't understand how Frank never play Rudiger, that guy is a beast and one of Chelsea main starter. Good lineup, let's go lads üíôüíôüíô. 2:0 to Chelsea, the best team in the world.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Not one of those players would have got in the 05 team,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
I can‚Äôt believe Tammy is not involved at all. ü§¶üèΩ,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
It's advisable you be consistent as a fan. I see some asking whereabouts of Abraham. Last season most of us did curse Abraham because of his repeated missed chances and others were like don't play him. What has changed that you missing him back...to hell!!,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Come on blues let's make every minute counts üíôüíô,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
PLEASE TUCHEL USE THE PLAYERS THAT PLAYED SECOND HALF AGAINST ASTON VILLA I MEAN PLACE WERNER HAVERTZ MONT PULSIC( OR HODSON ODOI) ZIYECH KANTE JAMES RUDIGER SILVA AZPI CHILWELL MENDY,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"One corner one goal. Chelsea has played many corners and no goal. Meanwhile, the referee must be kidding that in this game, Jack is still playing with no yellow card and Chelsea has two yellow cards.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Come on the blues we can do 3rd spot,",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"But seriously we Don expose our self to man city finish...

I think he(tuchel) was hiding the team from Man City. But he gat to win manhhh",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Tuchel should have put Kai Havertz in sooner and please take that overrated Mascot away in Champion league final.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
If this is the line up then we will lose this game,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Come on Blues,it's in our hands.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
If we get points deducted for the Leicester handbags at dawn this game will be for nothing.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"But Werner should play from Wing, the Coach should use another CF",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"From Kenya , lets do it guys since we have quality players,just let's rough up in style.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"A win is a must and I believe we'll get it because we're on our own, not looking over shoulders; forward ever backwards never! At least 2 goals and it's a win for us. Bluuuuuueeees Forever üíôüôåü§©‚öΩ‚öΩüôèüá¨üá≠üèÜüôè",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Best wishes team blue. This game is not only the final game of 2020/2021 season but its the first game of our next season's UCL. Fight hard and get the 3 points...we all rally behind you,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
I don't know why TT play Azpilicueta and James in the same match. It doesn't make sense to me,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
That's the team right thur come on blues finish da business,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"How I wish Olivier Giroud could take the place of Werner.. Anyways,all the best lads and give us the ticket for UCL next season.üíôüíôüí™üèºüí™üèº",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
For today TT could have started Harvetz as false 9. His combination and Pulisic is unmatched. Anyway am just a Rastaman. Not a rich man. Jah guide us till last minute. We dea. üíôüíôüíôüíô,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
With this line up I expect 3 straight points....,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Its a win. Go Chelsea!!,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
A talent like Havertz appears once every hundred years he should not be wasted on the bench unless injured,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
A sincere request from a die hard fan who never commented here ever before because of believing in the club's project ....but now I have no choice but to cause we are facing man city in the UCL Finals and we got to make no mistakes once and for all ..... DON'T LET WERNER IN THE STARTING LINE UP PLSSSSSSüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ LET HIM COME AFTER THE 75'MINS IF NEEDED ONLY OTHERWISE (PUT GIROUD AND TAMMY ABRAHAM IN FRONT TOGETHER üî•üî•üî•üî•)üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Jorginho has to be sold. I mean he always gives away ball at the back and can't defend. So what being the top scorer through penalties?,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
With this squared Chelsea should give them 4 : 0. And get thier enemies more pains,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
No kante even on the bench üòû its for the final ucl or kante got an injury ?? Im not realy sure when tuchel said kante is in a good condition on the pers.,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
With this line winning possibility is high actually,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Villa has Terry as their assistant Manager, John's our legend, Villa has nothing to play for...if you don't understand this then l don't know what you want",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Chelsea 4: 1 Aston Villa
Mount and Pulisic to score",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
3 points are massive champions league football is a must to get big signings in the summer transfer window,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"I don't like the position Azp is playing, Odoi should be play there,",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Jorginho deserve some respect and accolade from us..he has helped the team alot,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Ma fellow Chelsea fan's am very confused with our coach,is it bcoz Abraham s black or what is it that he did wrong, am sorry but am not racist but if he was white he was going to be playing with the contribution that he gave when he was playing,the coach has to tell the truth rather than destroying the futures guy",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Tammy not even on sub then gilmour is thereüòèü§îü§î.
This I serious. This is beyond his way of playing. They must be something.
Anyway the lineup look strong. It's +3 today",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Some should warn Werner. Today is no day to waste chances,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Imagine lose this match and UCL final, disaster after long good season üòÅ",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Kante, Christiansen, Alonso, Giroud and Ziyech
will carry the extra load on Saturday.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"I feel so ashamed putting on my jersey to watch to rubbish.....I see Chelsea right now as Arsene Wenger Arsenal team a mid-table club, lack of game management blunt frontline individual mistakes a team without experience and drive for winning crucial matches",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
The issue is putting James at the back of azp ..but others I'm good,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
We are winning this üíô pride of London,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
No single player from Chelsea team play with hunger to win. Chelsea might be out of top 4..........,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"An absolut utter disgrace,to lose it all in that manner.
All the work for nothing!",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Unlucky werner still tt choice..how they will get a goal??,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Tommy Abraham this is the game we needed to use him Ziyech and Hudson-odoi come on Managers please do something,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Given this lineup for today, we moght see Havertz starting against ManC in UEFA Champions League final",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Why won't Tuchel just use Giroud ao we can make use of crosses.

Giroud also pulls defenders in which would create room for Pulisic to attack and push,also get a shot whilst Mount can also get some shots in",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Why Giroud wouldn't gave a first chance then?,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Chelsea needs strikers. All upfront re wasteful. Christian pulisic needs to be substituted for Hudson,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
what did pulisic and werner do the first half? nth!!!!,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
But What did Abraham do to the coach??üëÄ,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Touchel hang your head in shame. Tammy Abraham should be on the bench, not Giroud.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Which supersport channel will this match be aired on?,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Jorginho should stop doing unnecessary back passes, those passes are causing us problems. We can‚Äôt afford to lose or draw this game, the lads should watch Grealish and Watkins. congratulations
in advance to usüëåüèø",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Poor tammy he's been banging in goals and don't even make the bench,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Where is Kante?,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Why does this coach play James in CB other than Aspi,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Werner out! He is not Drogba The legend. Very fast player, but awful striker.",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Remove Kovacic, Jorginho, Chilwell with immediate effect",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
come on my blues win loose or draw blue will always be my colour chelsea chelsea,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Why is it that any time we have kepa on the post.we can't record clean sheet,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
Billy Gilmour is a far better option then Jorginho i honestly don't get what's with the hype with him. I also don't see why CHO is so out of favor,372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1
"Oh no, kovacic the guy who doesn't defend....or either score a goal or make an assist",372,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Away,-1

"I can‚Äôt get my head around Murphy not starting. He makes so much of a difference when he comes on the pitch. Hopefully he‚Äôll bring him on and get some decent game time, but he does deserve to be in the starting 11 in my opinion.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Glad Miggy is back but Carroll, Ritchie & Murphy should be starting. What's Slowlinton gonna do? A relegation match, and we continue playing a ¬£40M flop. Can only see a Brighton win. They did well against Southampton.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Good to see Almiron back - not so good to see Joelinton on the pitch - another opportunity lost, I fear...",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"We are in a dog fight, need players with a bit about them on the pitch, Carrol and Ritchie should be starting",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"What has Andy Carroll got to do to get a start. Especially against a defence like Brighton who look quite tall and physical. Not forgetting Joelinton couldn‚Äôt hit a barn door if he was sat on the handle! üôà. One positive, having Miggy back. Such a big game, I hope they‚Äôre up for this. Howay the Lads! ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"This is probably our best lineup, apart from Wilson and Saint-Maximin missing. I just hope Carroll gets throw in earlier if Joelinton doesn‚Äôt get off to a good start.

We‚Äôve got an excellent centre-back squad, so no worries who slots in next to Lascelles. I also think that‚Äôs our best Fullback pairing to start a match. Allows Jamal Lewis to come on fresh, which is the best scenario for him since he‚Äôs more attacking minded.

Come on the boys! ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Joelinton definitely has an always start clause in his contract like! Huge risk rushing Almiron back! Why aren't we giving Murphy a chance.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"I really wanted Bruce to succeed at Utd but his failure to see what everyone else can that joelinton is a total liability, he stubbornly refuses to change and will bring us relegation.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Thought Carroll would have been useful today against a tall Brighton defense. But unreal to see Miggy back, just what we needed! Come on boys ‚ö´‚ö™",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
It looks a better side already with miggy in the line up. Glad krafth has been dropped but would of loved Murphy to of started tonight. If we can get 3 points it would be great!! Wilson & ASM hopefully to return soon too HTL ‚óºÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Happy with that. Dummett and manq have been sorely missed. Shows the state of affairs sadly.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
I can't believe joelinton is in again surely Carroll would have been a better bet with Almiron and fraser playing off him but what do us supporters know,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Hope Miggy hasn‚Äôt been rushed back too soon. Don‚Äôt expect him to be on for the full 90. Also, got wrong Longstaff on bench.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Get in Miguel Almiron Son glad he is Back fit and fresh from Injury along with Javier Manquillo in our One and Only Mighty Toon Army‚Äôs Starting 11 to Face Brighton and Hove Albion Away at the Amex Stadium 8PM Tonight for our Massive Must Win Game and Reckon we will Take all Three Points Back to the Toon HWTL Forever And Always UP The Mighty Mags For Life

What does Murphy have to do to get a start? Amazing to see Miggy back but hope it isn't rushed and he gets injured again. HWTL !,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Maybe Murphy for Fraser but best team he could pick. Defence looks good. Hope Miggy is ready,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Worst performance from Newcastle I can ever remember. None of that team are good enough to wear the shirt. This is a relegation fight FFS. Pathetic is an understatement.
I could put 11 lads together who would play for Newcastle for free who would do better than that. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Get out of our club the lot you.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"No striker again.....and bruces immense player jokelinton gives us all hope.........th
ank god for alcohol",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"So when Joelinton gets his chances this week Bruce is expecting him to put them away is he? What‚Äôs changed?
Murphy and Carrol will be fuming.
Unbelievable",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
So Steve Bruce thinks it‚Äôs ok to go into a must win game without a striker on the pitch. Beyond words!,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Surely any of those outfield substitutes is more deserving of a start than Joelinton. First job of whoever takes over is find out who sanctioned that move - and fee - and boot them out of the club.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Everyone going on about miggy, yes he works hard every game, but what can he do on his own up front? Not getting a decent service and he's always expected to carry the ball a long distance. He'd do well with better players... Or better management of the team!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
What has joelinton got to not do before he does not start. Manquillo and dummet are shocking. How does Murphy not start and why not give Carroll a go from start. Least he‚Äôll try and bring spake passion unlike joelinton. We NEED to win this. I fear the worse,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Carroll,Richie & Murphy on the bench again in a game where leaders and passion is needed ü§Ø
Where is the now coach and boyhood support that has stood on the Gallowgate as a lad that wants the club to move forward and play in an attacking way.
O i forgot he is sitting behind Steve Bruce üò°",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Is Bruce trying to get us relegated!! We need goals and he has 2 strikers on the bench. He blindly continues with options that gives us very little up top. Carroll and Murphy should have started. Sick of this week after week.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Shelvey has definitely been doing some toe sucking to keep his place, the blokes a disgrace",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Not the line up I would of gone with I would of started Murphy and Carroll and Ritchie but pleased Almiron is back, such a big game and this is a must WIN game!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"It‚Äôs good enough to beat Brighton, or should be anyway. Bruce tactics makes nothing certain",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Hope big Joe continues his excellent run of form of late and gets a goal to top it off. Murphy needs 30 minutes tonight or from whenever Miggy runs out of steam,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"4 minutes in and predictable already. No attacking threat. Weak at the back. Zero connection throughout the team.
I hope this comment comes back to haunt me, however I very much doubt it.

BRUCE OUT! HOWE IN!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Joe Linton in the team again, obviously gonna use his pace and heading prowess in the box. Why oh why does he get a game? Once Bruce gets sacked it has to come out, Ashley must be telling him to play him.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Only change I‚Äôd have done Murphy for Fraser but glad Manquillo‚Äôs back missed him massively,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Glad to see miggy back. Was hoping Murphy would get a start. Must win. Hwtl,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Should have started with Carroll and Murphy but pleased to see Miggy back. Joelinton will not score again. Needs sold in the summer,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
I‚Äôve watched the toon for 55 years and I can honestly say I‚Äôve never seen a player as bad as joelinton . Yes some have come very close but not as bad considering the price tag . What the hell is going on .,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Hope Almiron isn't being rushed back to soon. Would have liked to see Murphy given a start as think he has done decent when coming on as sub recently. Wonder if Carroll will get more than 1 minute tonight ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Murphy and Carrol should be in there from the start,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Not a bad team at all and as long as Murphy gets half an hour I‚Äôd be gappy,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Nice to see Almiron and Manquilo back starting but disappointed not to see Murphy given a start over Fraser. Continuing to play Joelinton in number 9 role is going to result in another game we struggle to score.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Apart from shelvey I quite like that line up can see us getting a W,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why persist with joelinton we needs goals and he ain‚Äôt a goalscorer,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
I‚Äôve literally no idea why Joelinton is constantly in this side. It‚Äôs honestly as though they want us relegated on purpose,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
He had to start with Carroll n Murphy tonight like. Brighton 2nd worst record in the league defending set pieces,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Murphy must be hiding Bruce's pasties! He should be in,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Glad almiron is back, how Murphy doesn‚Äôt get a start is beyond me! And surely Matt Richie should start, in my opinion the left back spot should be his!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
What has Murphy got to do to get a start!,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
tonight's the night I'm a millionaire put a 5a on linton hatrick,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Joelinton starts. Madness. He does absolutely nothing,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Murphy motm last game and played 15mins, is that stupid t--t reet in the heedüò†",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Better but why joelinton start either Carroll or Gayle,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Glad to see miggy back! Biggest game of the season so far and no striker on the pitch ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Almiron back is massive, our best player by a mile. I can see a few goals for him tonight!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Good defensive line up I know dummet or Clark rarely try to get up field but they are solid and do their jobs well,hopefully the rest will do their jobs too with miggy back might breathe some confidence in the rest cmon the toon ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Every game we play the other team always plays better and is on the front foot. We seem scared and trying not to lose a goal rather than scoring a goal,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Considering this is a must win game, this team doesn‚Äôt exactly fill me with hope!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why is lascelles playing he is awful twice now he was caught out in wrong position we have only played 7 mins when are we going to learn the man is an absolute waster of defender üò©üò©,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
What‚Äôs Murphy gotta do fml. Hendrick starting is a disgrace. Only time you know he‚Äôs been on is when he gets subbed off,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Joelinton off for caroll. It's not like we play champagne football so might as well have him up there causing trouble. The man needs a stint in the U23s for his confidence and no I'm not joking!,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Play Gayle, why stick with Joelinton?! It's not going to happen Bruce give up already, 4 4 2 with Carroll and Gayle and go for it.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"If Steve Bruce aka cabbage heed is reading this. F@##king he'll you need Steve Barnes, not Steve Bruce today. A striker indeed.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
This game is already lost. NU not trying to win just trying to stop Brighton from winning. Disgraceful.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Give carol a go, he will give his all, even if he gives 80%its still better than jolinton, cut your loss on him, think of the club, and if your not starting mat ritchie, you deserve the name clown and cabbage",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Everyone is hating on Bruce yeah he is to blame massively but what are the ""team"" playing at what happened to the team who had heart and left everything on the pitch. How many times do we need to do this before we realise what it's doing to the club. We will be playing Gateshead in no time.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Steve Bruce in the last chance saloon. Totally devoid of ideas,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Pathetic result. This squad should be seeing him better results. If only we had a prominent manager that could get the best out of them... ü§î oh wait...,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
I would have started Murphy over joe and maybe longstaff over johnjo but miggy is a positive sign,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Hope Miggy is actually fit rather than being thrown in out of desperation. Joelinton and Fraser should have been dropped for Murphy and Gayle/Carroll but as we have seen Joelinton is indispensable. I mean how would we manage without his 3 goals in over 60 games?,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
This is a 6 pointer. Really hope we can be attacking. If we sit back then you know he only wants a point.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Joelinton is the worst striker in the league as for a winger he would be pushing to win the worst winger in the championship award. Bruce is deluded.
Give murphy a chance",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
A draw is the minimum tonight! Absolutely cannot let Brighton pull away,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Murphy over joelinton and we have to give one of the strikers at least 20 mins tonight,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"If you must play Joelinton (and I've no idea why you must), then put him out wide to feed strikers with some confidence. We need someone to shoot when they're in front of goal!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why joelinton yet again?,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Murphy was our best player after he came on the last game yet he still doesn't start our most important game of the season !,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Absolutely dreadful first half display,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Get a tenner on a Joelinton hatrick at 125/1 tonight‚Äôs the night boys!!!!! Love his hair, 40 mil well spent.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Murphy should be playing instead of Joelinton,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Dunk will Eat Joe from Linton. Carol better choice against him.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"I must be the only one of our fans that feels bad for joe, his work rate and ability isn‚Äôt even at question for me, he‚Äôs just lacking in confidence in front of goal and that‚Äôs all some of our fans see, in a team of under performers he‚Äôs been one of the better players for me, he cost 40m, was given the number 9 shirt and we expected wonders but as i‚Äôve said many times he‚Äôs never been an out and out goal scorer, he played on the wing for hoffenheim, i want him to do well and shut some of our fans up, i personally think he has more to offer than carroll other than height and physicality, the best thing about this line up apart from obviously almiron is no krafth, really want us to win this one, we need to ‚óæÔ∏è‚óΩÔ∏è‚óæÔ∏è‚óΩÔ∏è‚óæÔ∏è",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
setting us up to hit them on the counter and defend the whole game when we should be going for this hope walks after tonight like i had up here of his rubbish tactics like,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Why, why why is Joelinton playing again? And why risk Miggy from the start should of started Carroll, Gayle, Murphy and Richie.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Has anyone done any painting.......
...............
.I'll watch it dry for you. This is dire!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why does he persist with Joelinton....?,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"61st minute not a single shot on target so far, well done Newcastle,""you can run but you can't score""",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Glad to see Manquillo and Almiron back in the team. Now we just need to drop Joelinton and Shelvey for Gayle and either of the Longstaff's (though preferably Matty) and we might have a shot,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why does he persist with joelinton? For the love of God he can't play as a striker,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
10 starting ....yet again ! Why doesn't he accept Woelinton is üí©?,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Wtf, Almiron will now play down the middle and Fraser on the Left no doubt. Last game was a missed opportunity having Gayle play centrally from the start. Dunno what Murphy has to do to start! Play poorly it seems and you get picked. We know Ritchie is never getting off the bench whilst Bruce is in charge, and Jokelinton will always start no matter how bad he is.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"An absolute must win game and he picks joelinton, will this never end",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Team is picked guys let‚Äôs not debate and get behind the team this game got a Fraser goal written all over it,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Buzzing miggys back üôåüèº bruce doing a good job killing matty longstaff off aswell by the looks how the fook is hendrick getting in the squad over him,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Murphy should have started looking for the sack tonight hopefully,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Murphy deserves a start today,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Not a shot on goal from us so far, rubbish!!!!!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
have no faith in goals with joelinton on the pitch he couldnt score in a brothel,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Would play the full bench instead of the nuggets he's starting with,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Brucie says he hasn't been good enough so why the brazillian donkey again,must be after his p45 and pay off.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"What is it with playing - No Goals Joelinton
Just play Gayle,
Think if he gets a decent amount of playing time he will start banging them in
That's just my opinion tho üòÉ",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why oh why is joe from linton playing again and why not give a murphy a chance,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Brighton 3-0. Won‚Äôt even both watching either. Bruce out,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Well done Steve,let‚Äôs keep starting a striker averaging a goal every 20 games üôÑ",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Come on Newcastle! Good luck in today's game. NU ‚ô•,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Get rid of all those over paid lazy players like jonjo he did no marking at all . Over rated,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
None of them deserved to Wear the shirt after that performance championship side that's what we are,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Joelinton swap for Carroll fraser swap for Murphy... But could of bee a worse selection surprised hendrick isn't playing,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Miggy s back.in gutted only got bt sport . I got a feelingggggg a feelinggggg, miggy is about to score, but not with a womannn, but with a goaaallll. Howayy the Miggyyy. Lol. Chang and Corona ahhhhh. HWTLadsssss and Miggy",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Hope migi doesnt get crocked again he wont last 90 mons murphy should have been on wing frazer the other joelinton where hes best on bench carroll up top fs bruce if joe doesnt score tonight play him at cb then as we have better midfielders in reseves a think joe is rubbish yeah his all round game is better but didnt pay 40 mil for another friggin hendrick fs not and never going to be a goalscorer üôà,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Got a good feeling about tonight, with miggy and manquillo back.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Need miggy fit if he has him back 2 fast and he gets injured again üôÑ,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why not Murphy? He looked a threat last week. Same old same old,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Bruce, go now, don't wait to get sacked. Do the decent thing and empty your desk tomorrow and retire from football altogether.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Mjs corpse would have more purpose than Joelinton,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Set up and playing like we were playing Man City, embarrassing",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
I would never of started him tbh he‚Äôs just come back of injury,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Joelinton must have pictures of Ashley in a gimp suit to be starting each game.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why won‚Äôt he play Andy Carroll???,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
How the hell does young Anderson not even get on bench.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
How bad do you have to be before your dropped what other premier team would still be playing Joelinton ?,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Carrol needs minutes the night like Murphy should be starting for me as well!,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Joelinton shouldn't be in team I'd have Carroll or Murphy over Joelinton n Matty longstaff over shelvey,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"We need goals and what does Bruce do ,you leave your centre forwards on the bench???",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Murphy and Carroll benched again... they must be woeful in training because everytime they play in a match they light up the game... must be a reason they can't get a start...,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Not sure what i'm more happy about. Almir√≥n in or Hendrick out!,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why os gayle not playing up front bruce,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Jokefkinlinton again FFS, Already 1 short, playing with 10 men,, we need goals , not some fkn donkey strolling around the pitch,",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Why not be adventurous and play Carroll, Gayle and Miggy no let‚Äôs just stick one up top!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Never heard Slowingtons name mentioned...is he playing ?,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Should have started with Gayle instead of Joelimpton. üòï,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Goalkeeper and defence fine. Joelinton wilock hayden Fraser almiron and gayle. We would won easy. Make me manager. Fight for Premier league.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Looking forward to Murphy coming on at 85 mins üëç,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
How do we have a manager who consistently fails to put a striker in the starting 11? Like honestly this is just embarrassing.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
How Murphy doesn't start is mad fs,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Yes kraft outa proper right back put in. Looks quite solid. Need goali ton to step up and be counted,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3
Saw the Fulham game last night and they were so bad worse the us that is for sure. Not got good feelings about tonight,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,-3

This will either be highly embarrassing or we will get a good result. Not sure about the starting 11 but then we don‚Äôt appear to have a very good squad at the moment. Why do we have so many injured players again? Not in Europe and out of the cups so what is going on! Maybe we need to sack the fitness coaches.,301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0

I do believed that most of the injuries is due to the rigorous training that the players is not accustomed too. Players must realise that the good old days is over and it is a new beginning for Everton FC. We will be at number 8 position for 20/21 season. We will certainly be in the top 6 next season once the players is accustomed to the training regime.,301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0
"Everton‚Äôs team against Brighton was badly affected by injuries to Allan, DCL, Doucoure and Gbamin and had been cobbled together. Once again the connectivity between defence and attack was not effective enough and considering possession was quite well balanced between the two teams Brighton did much lore with it and in all honesty were kind to us in goal scoring situations. We had to defend stoutly but the team looked ponderous and Richy and James had little effective support and James perhaps. Was Josh King also injured?",301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0
"Can‚Äôt be angry with Carlo here. I look at Brands and think why did we pay for Josh King, failed fitness test, hasn‚Äôt played more than 30 minutes in a single game. It was clear Carlo didn‚Äôt want him, but again we panic bought like we did with Iwobi. We have no players left. Must be a wonder what‚Äôs happening in the physio and board room.",301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0
"We need to get more than 65/70 minutes out of James today, as Iwobi is our only senior outfield option off the bench. We've been terrible for injuries this season, but you've not once seen Carlo moan about it in the media. Team looks defensive, however I think Digne and Coleman have looked our best attacking options recently. Could be a blessing in disguise this.
Or at least I'll tell myself that ü§£ COYB üíôüíô",301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0
"This team is WORSE than the Mike Walker days. Boring to watch, frightening in defence and cant pass . Scared of shooting and cant walk it in. We are so poor it is shameful. We live on past glories with hope at the start of the season gone by October. The team is full of over rated journey men with no will to win. I hate having a go at my beloved team BUT I have had enough of this now and when the fans get back Ancelotti will know what it is like to be good off at half time.",301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0
"That was dire. We seem to be getting worse as the season goes on. We are talking Brighton here, not Man City or United. We never looked like we were going to win that game. Roll on the end of the season.",301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0
"Worse team I have seen for years, we are setting up to defend for the whole 90 minutes, we will lose if they score, so disappointed.",301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0
"After watching all our games this season, I must say we are the worst team to watch, ok weve won a few away, but never dominated. This is typical Italian football. Even Allerdise played better football, midfield is dreadful.",301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0
Oh well... If we are going to experiment... Might as well do it in this season... James as the 2nd striker with Gylfi pulling the strings and vice versa? Coleman and Digne providing the width. Holgate sitting in front of the back 3 and Davies doing the box to box work... Good luck boys... Do your best,301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0

That first half was a tough watch. Couldn‚Äôt see us scoring if we were here for a week. Regardless of injuries we need to show more energy and better passing if we hope to get anything out of this game.,301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0
Every good Evertonien knows that we already need better quality players at the club if we want to be successful. So even if we make Europe this season Carlo will still need better quality players to do well in Europe next year.,301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0

Why are we so rubbish!!! Sick of watching this rubbish. Can we have some midfielders that can run and get rid of Iwobi.,301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0
What do this squad of players do in training is what I ask myself. Got to be something wrong somewhere along the line. Tonight's bench is awful. The only sub he will use is Iwobi all others will have to play 90+ mins,301,Brighton,Everton,Away,0

Naming two keepers on the bench is just petty playground stuff from Dyche. Okay so he doesn‚Äôt trust another U23 to step up but that‚Äôs no excuse not to include one of them in the Match-day squad over Norris and give them a taste of it so they crack on and prove to him they are ready.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1

I just wish he would give Vidra a start.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Wood scored the winner v Palace with a one on one. He‚Äôs scored many goals for Burnley. Scores lots of headers from balls whipped in from the wide men. Unfortunately due to having to rebuild from the back after Ben Mee‚Äôs absence the quality of crosses from open play and free kicks has been lacking. Clarets are on their best run of form since last season and Dyche rarely changes the side unless an injury forces him to do so. Jay and Vydra also good players who will be chomping at the bit if they are needed later in the game. It will be a tough call tonight as Wolves generally don‚Äôt give much away at the back. Could be a 1-0 either way.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Is this a message to the board...2 keepers?!?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Sorry but Wood should be on the bench and JRod lead the attack with Barnes or Vydra. More to the point where is Vydra?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Why no Vydra I wonder,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
James Denslow - why not Jay Rod. Wood is so slow. No Vydra either - is he injured?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1

You don't play Kilman and Ait together they need experience next to them.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
I understand why Boly had to be replaced but why mess with the rest.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
"Awful game, no purpose, no urgency, no composure.
We donÀãt have the answer for Jimenez",132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
is Adama still training with Usain Bolt? üòÇüòÇüòÅüòÅ,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
"Otasowie had a great first half shame none others can say the same, Burnley play one way come on Nuno sort it out, They are one dimensional that's why there bottom 3 come on FFS !",132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Wolves neets more offensiv players and a stabil gold scorrer,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Otasowie looked brilliant against Chelsea. Glad he's been given a start üëçüèº,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Marcel could be carrying a knock as he wasn't training the other day,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Otasowie to start what a talent Nuno brings through we are well on our way to true greatness again. In Nuno i trust. We got this poss high score here,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Shocked there is no Marcel would of been one of the first on the team sheet for me!! Great to see otasowie starting still a great line up!,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Would love to see corbeanu get some playing time. Real talented lad full of energy and jazz,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
"Where‚Äôs Dendoncker? Not criticising, just wondering if he‚Äôs injured?",132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
"This line up makes sense against ""hoof ball Burnley""!!!
Mid 3 means they won't be able to get over our mid/back line and then our quick counter with otasowie supporting will work really good!!!",132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
3-5-2 is not bad we can win 1-2,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
What going on with Adama? Why hes not able to be a regular starter this year ?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
"Nice to see the young lads getting first team action, theres some talent there looking forward to watching Otasowie again and I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing Corbeanu getting a crack",132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
"Changing a winning team ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è i really don't think Kilman and Ait Nouri are good enough yet either. I like the look of Otasowie, but he's gonna need to hold his own tonight. I know he's a big lad, but he's now playing with men... not boys in the u23s.
I hope it proves to be a good move, because for me, this side will get beat tonight by Burnley",132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
What a night for Otasowie! Good luck,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
"very interesting line up....i don't anyone would of predicted that.
nice to see perry and corbeanu make the bench, both look great future talents.
we should be able to control the midfield nicely, plenty of magic up top but only concern is no target man to hold the ball up.
3 points needed. come on the wolves.",132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1

I think Fabio just needed a couple more consecutive starts to build his confidence up as he's improving,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
"like the changes! otasowie and ait-nouri starting, good to see kilman at the back. Still think saiss should be further up the pitch, a good cover. think this could be a positive start!",132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
"A different starting line up but just goes to show how far our younger players are coming, Nouri, Otasowie and Kilman all trusted to start, with Perry and Corbaneu looking to get on too. Love it, hope the boys can impress and keep pushing our first teamers FWAW!",132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
love that midfield otasawie must be improvung so much to be selected,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Finally back to the system of old proper wing backs,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
That‚Äôs a very attacking line up. Hopefully it will work against Burnley and their terrible anti-football. Should be worth a red card at least against them cloggers.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Disappointed that Fabio didn't start,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Both full backs look weak.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
"Positive team selection for me bearing in mind upcoming games.
Great to see Otasowie starting after very good display against Chelsea.
Good to see Perry & Corbeanu on bench.
Can see a comfortable Win hopefully üò¨
Or a boring 1-0 will do I suppose üòÅ",132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Great line up and good bench.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Why the negative comments ? Fabio not scoring ..boly not fit .. traore out of form,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Don‚Äôt know what to think unless he is saving them for the Tottenham game,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Good luck but i would like to see us have a constant rotating front 3 tonite of adama daniel and netto bag. Neves goes a bit into his shell when 3 man cent mid. But COYW,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1

Bit surprised with the team but let‚Äôs see how it goes 1st before you all start support the boys,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Going for Nouri over Marcal is a pretty attacking move. I‚Äôd have preferred the experience of Marcal but best leave team selections to Nuno üôÇ,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
Glad to see otasowie play he impressed me last game let‚Äôs get another win today come on wolves üü†‚ö´Ô∏è,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1
That looks strong... No Traore is a blessing. Otasawie looked good last time out. Feel this could be a good game.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Away,-1

"FFS negative moaners again - what should Dyche do ? Put injured players on the bench to keep you happy ?

3 points tonight, played well at Leeds just need to bury our chances now, and hope for a decent ref !

Rodriguez took a crack not long after coming on v Leeds and hobbled around for most of the remainder of the game. It might explain his absence,152,Burnley,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
If this is the strongest squad of players we've got we seriously need this takeover . 2 keepers 3 defenders and 3 kids is not good enough. Pieter's is average at best and Brady will be lucky to get 60 minutes out of. Why on earth we resigned Gudmondson baffles me he's a liability,152,Burnley,Sheffield Utd,Home,1

Great finish to a good season 3 wins from the last 3 games mot,352,Burnley,Leeds,Away,4
"Good luck lads, that is one strong team!",352,Burnley,Leeds,Away,4
"Seeing the bench, thinking it would be nice to see Berardi start one of last two games, or at least get on as a sub.
Not sure that it will happen, though, not Marcelo‚Äôs style. He will put the strongest team out, and expect them to run as much as ever until the 94th minute.",352,Burnley,Leeds,Away,4

"I AM A NEW LEEDS UNITED FAN,i joined last week,and i really love the way u guys play,quick and rapid fire without fear,lets push higher for a european position.",352,Burnley,Leeds,Away,4
Overall a good team. Disappointed to see Koch not in the squad. He performed well while Cooper was suspended and think he is the future along with Llorente and Struijk. Cooper is Leeds through and through ‚ù§Ô∏è but we have to look forward now.,352,Burnley,Leeds,Away,4
"Almost a wasted opportunity to give the youngsters some first team game time.... just playing out the season now. Imagine the boost for some of these kids to get 30 mins+. Having said that, in Bielsa we trust. ALAW.üôÇ",352,Burnley,Leeds,Away,4
"Strujik has over taken Cooper in my eyes, he's far more competent.
Good to see KP and Rapha back starting.
Come on lads!

"Here go, performance will drop from last week and we have to watch Phillips doing his sideways and backwards passes.........

"Starting XI is on fire!
Paddy momentum gives a 16th goal, and the creative madness from Raphinha nets another. And if Harrison decides to have one of his confident long-range-shoo

"Quality lineup. Where is Koch? and it's a shame Pablo can't grab a bench spot, would love to see him run out for us a couple more times.",352,Burnley,Leeds,Away,4
"Very strange dropping Koch when we are playing against two strikers, could have played him and moved KP to CM as I anticipate KP now will make the 3 in CB position and will play to deep. Even if Bielsa wanted to drop Koch why not then to the bench instead of Cooper. Koch I am told is not injured",352,Burnley,Leeds,Away,4

"Surely Rodrigo should start over Klich! Record signing fit to play and only 3 games left, let him run the last few games",352,Burnley,Leeds,Away,4

"I'm just happy that Barnes is not playing. Our fragile defense will get a relief. Robertson must just ensure that Westwood is denied space to cross the ball and hoping that ee will also avoid unnecessary free kicks.

As for our line up, there is nothing we can do about it. I just made peace with it. Salah is on his own to save us, thats all I can say given the injuries.",362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3
"Good strong midfield selection & we must use the creativity of Alcantara to break any of their defensive line!

Attack wins u games but defence wins u titles!",362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3
"Winaldum again, And captain too..... Frigging hell, Take it we are definitely buying a replacement for this Barcelona player in the summer as Klopp doesn't want to play any of our current squad in his place for some bizarre reason. Hope he doesn't play as he has done in recent games. He was the only player on the team that DIDN'T celebrate Alissons remarkable goal. Says it all really üò°",362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3
I want to be able to eat my words from this game but I really don't think wijnaldum has the passion for the club that he used To. Specially after the Allison goal celebrations,362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3
"Guess Koumetio was going to be a better option than Williams....onl

"Hello Reds, and hello Mr. Klopp...
Oh a big chance for the guys in the top4 race today. My BVB made it last weekend but this season would be only perfect for a fan like me when i could see Liverpool also in the CL next season.
Great line-up, so good luck for the guys and Mr. Klopp - time for another magic moment match - and all the best for Mr. van Dijk and for the fantastic fans of LFC.
Heja BVB...",362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3
Good luck lads...this game is going to be tough...we need to score early...,362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3
"Imagine watching Liverpool and us having the game done and dusted by half time, what a nice feeling that would be ü§£ü§£",362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3
Thought we should have gone with an attacking midfielder like Shaq or Ox to try break down that defense,362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3
The team line up is basically predictable even before the announcement. LFC needs depth in team.. I would love to see Chamberlain plays more often next season,362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3
Strange choice to start Allison in goal if you ask me much more effective up top,362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3

what a fricking insult Winaldam is to the team right now. he plays with no intent or desire. Klopp need to remove him from the team let alone give him a chance in the final game. He will be the reason Liverpool will not play C.L.,362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3

Hate to see Georgino Wijnaldum start matches for us these days. He brings almost nothing to the 3rd field. Oxy or Shaqiri or better yet Jones would have been a better pick.,362,Burnley,Liverpool,Away,3

"Please make us happy again, we've already dropped 6points in two games, we don't have the energy to drop any point. Welcome back Odoi",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Lampard reads games poorly, why do we keep playing Werner out of position, and can't sub him or Abraham for Giroud. This team is very poor!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Tammy is just simply not good enough....I am not sure what he actually gives us, and what does Frank see in him??ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è he does not score- he does not hold the ball up- he does not create???",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
It is a good start. The boys are displaying utmost game intelligence. This is a sure win for the blues,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
3-defeats in row! You not gonna beat Westham with Jorginho in midfield. He has not creativity to unlock their stubborn defence nor the physicality to match them. Lampard shot himself in the foot again. Good luck üëå,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"West Ham are a very solid team, especially Rice and Ogbonna defensively. It will take a lot of use of Pulisic with his finesse and technique as well as Werner with his speed to destabilize the block. Mount has to bring a lot to the midfield today and in terms of defense, it will take great communication with the goalkeeper and Chilwell's fine strides.üí™üèæ

Good luck guys ... We are with you and above all proud of you üíôüôèüèæüá®üáÆ.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"We have not lost a game Abraham has started ,good omen",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"My fellow Chelsea brother let's leave Giroud's talk, he functions better when we have all the playing to ourselves but we all know we lost that already, we need someone to get defenders under pressure by serious ball chasing and marking. Tammy has that just that he's wasteful but that's not just our problem, the whole Frontline has been wasteful",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Bit of a strange decision putting abraham up front ahead of giroud, he hasn't done anything to justify being picked over giroud",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Whether you choose who or who,I don't care.what I want is a win so that my Manchester united friends making humour of me and my team Chelsea embraced. We will win",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I need to know why Chelsea bought Werner. When wingers are back, let him play as central forward. I hope I am wrong because I did not see Chelsea winning this one. We are playing against a team that collected 6 points from Chelsea last season.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"So mount can‚Äôt rest ü§î, why I see ppl talking on here saying mount fighting for his place in this team and he earned when really and truly he haven‚Äôt it was given to him idc what nobody says ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÖüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, lampard need to be back in the championship",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Jorginho is underated but he is very creative in the midfield nd can defend as well lets give him a chance too,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Start Abraham because he is the father of many Nations right? Okay!! Lampard dares not lose this game. Mtcheeeeew!!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Werner should be striker. Odoi and pulisic wingers. Ziyech replace one of the wingers when he is fit. Giroud is reserve striker or even partner Werner. Tammy have to wait or play in the u23.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I don‚Äôt know what Game Lampard was watching but if it was the same wolves and Everton game then he is not someone that learns from his mistakes
Hopefully he wins
Cuz we can‚Äôt finish 9th before new year",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"The fact that Chelsea is turning to a childish club is really heartbreaking

Slow Jorginho running the midfield against Declan Rice?
Tammy should go on loan to a Championship team again b4 he'll be ready for big team like Chelsea.
I prefer to play Wanner as a top striker and not a winger cos we're getting absolutely nothing good from him at the moment, Lampard is the one turning Wanner to a flop.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"It's a 'okay' starting XI although I would've loved Kovacic ahead of Jorginho and Giroud over Tammy. Let's just see how it goes, even with our best line up we can still lose game but I'm optimistic.
#KTBFFHüíôüíôüíô",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Great to see Hudson-Odoi back from his injury - hope to see him come on in the second half in case we need him! ‚úÖ,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Justice done. A cameo for Giroud and Kovacic will breath a new lease of life to the game. The boys are raring to go that's for sure. We will miss Reece big time,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Best lineup,,,happy to see jorginho starting,,he is the only player in chalsea apart from ziyech who can feed Werner a pass that suits his strength.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Lampard should be included in the a thousand ways of death. Why start Abraham and Jorgi ahead of Giroud and kova respectively. MADNESS MADNESS MADNESS MADNESS,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Glad to see Pulisic & Azpi back, hope their are 100%. I would really preferred Hudson to start instead of Mount. Lastly i hope Werner will be at his best level for goodness sake.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Abraham?! really,....we need someone who will take one chance and burry it.... Werner has played alot and i bet he's tired....wish kovacic and Giroud could have started....Anyw
ay All the best BLUES üíôüíôüíô",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I would have loved to see Giroud start ahead of Tammy, but I hope he comes good in this game.

Azpi may struggle to deal with the pace of West Ham attackers down the right flank.

Otherwise, I think it's a good lineup on paper.

Whoever plays, I hope they give it their best. Let's win this.

Go Chelsea!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Allow Mount to rest. Why should it always be about him? Am sure he also needs to rest and there are better players on the bench. Sometimes Frank is just too biased.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Wait what's special about this Abraham that boy is not a footballer he isn't even qualified to play our street ball,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Can someone tell frank that werner is stricker!!! Am sure Lampard will loose his job because of being stubbornness!!!
Tammy in center forward? What a f....ck!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Abraham starting ahead of Giroud?, Werner at the flank again?, Jorghino ahead of Kovacic? Lampard is a big joker and he will be sacked just like others no matter the legendary status he holds at Chelsea. We want results not experiments on English boysüò°üò°üò°",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Nice seeing Abraham back to the starting line up. We have lost 2 of the last 3 EPL games giroud has started so let's revert back to the old ways please. My only concern is jorginho destroying the rythm that midfield already has.

Victory all the way certainly",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Behind the manager as I have been behind when we were winning games,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"A very strong lineup but you should have started kovacic over jorginho Geroud over tamy Apraham apart from that the rest are good.....Some plastic fans here are saying Lampard out, plz let us give him time the way Liverpool gave klop enough time.....",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
This line up is not solid enough to give us 3 points at the bridge and iam afraid the hammers will give us problems. Let's emulate what Livers and the Zebras did on the weekend by scoring more goals. lord Giroud could have been in the starting lX. Otherwise the Zebras put up a good performance yesterday and could be the favourites to win the EPL title if we don't play our cards right!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"My Only Wish Is For Chelsea To Get A Better Coach, Who's A Master Tactician, Experienced And Doesn't Have Favouritism, That Way We Wont Lose To Top Half Opponents, Lose Unnecessarily, Have Players Out Of Their Natural Positions And Have Crazy Line Ups Like This One...

I Really Wish...",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Good that giroud is having a rest need him for the up coming games but shouldn‚Äôt put Abraham upfront should have werner,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"West Ham have big players and I don't think jorginho will be able to match their strengths in the midfield. Kovacic would have been a better option
We can win this and get our season upright again
KTBFFH üí™üí™",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I think there is a conspiracy between Lampard and Abraham, Chelsea needs to investigate Lampard, it's irritating benching Giraud for The lazy Abraham",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Finally mr havertz is back to where he should be .let‚Äôs get a win don‚Äôt know why kovavic isn‚Äôt starting tho üôÑ,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Disappointed not to see Giroud and Kovacic in the starting XIüòî and happy at the same time to see Havertz on the benchüí™üëèüòé,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why would you start Jorginho in a high intensity game? Abraham starting? Whichever,win or Lampard will face the wreath of an african witch",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why benching Giroud? This favoritism have to stop now, or someone will go back to Derby County",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
When is Werner gonna play striker instead of being wasted on the wings,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"What will help us in this match is if we take our chances well in the earlier stage, we would surely be victorious.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Cm'on guys.. My concern is that, if Pulisic is playing left wing. I really don't care much where others are playing. A must win game",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why did you delete the earlier post and posted it again, maybe we need our admin out alongside Lampard.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What type of formation is this?? Where is Giroud???,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Poor team selectionüòü‚òπÔ∏èüöÆ, how is mount better than kovacic? werner out of position, kante will surely suffer today.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why bench Harvetz?Why Mount in the mid...

Another lose. Lampard out.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why Abraham lazy boy walking in the field nkt,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Cannot see us winning this one with abraham up front Lampard has no clue playing players out of position time should be main striker,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Chelsea should go with false 9 instead and put Werner infront with Haverts and Pulisic on the wings. Giroud should honestly come on as a second half player just to push the attack more. Kovacic should start in place of jorginho with kante holding the midfield alongside him. Mount plays an attacking role. I really think Lampard should think more from a players perspective(suc
h as its traits and abilities and comfortability as well). Chelsea has a good team but they not just playing their role really. Ive been a chelsea supporter all my life and I can say that players are playing better when they playing their role and play freely",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Really today Timo Werner gonna score goal because Jorginho is there but also whole team we need a good performance on this game so as to rescue the victory on this game.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Sometimes this Lampard looks confused. Why play Jorginho when we have Kovacic. Why play Abraham when we have Giroud. Why play Mount when we have Havertz. We seriously need 3 points please. But I can smell a defeat of 1-0,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Mount must b a superman..alway
s available..neve
r tired..plays all wings..won't b surprised to c him in goal sumday...",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Hope big Tammy score tonight and hope Werner gets back on form, come on lads lets do this tonight üîµüîµ",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Omg tonight we are playing with 10 men Tammy should not be any where near the fist team, dream or loss tonight for sure",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"just watched first half and week by week the team are getting worse no pressing , very few tackles, every thing passed back into a packed midfield, as much as i admire lampard i think this has come to soon for him, we need players that give 100%not just drift in and out of games.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"We displayed our best arrangement in defense with Kante in front of back four, Cova, Mase in the middle and the three attackers Timo, Pulisic Verner and Tammy / Giroud. Ziech and Havertz could come in as subs
When Chilli and Reece are fit they can replace Azpi and Emerson.
Also it is good to have three other subs competing for full backs.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"It a bad lineup why this cow Abraham and This old guy why James not playing

Lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampardüöÆüöÆüöÆüò™üíîAnd if we lose today he must go üöÆ",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"if he starts us with that slow crap across the back, the game is over, we need to attack and counter attack at speed with numbers and remind kante he isn't a striker, but is the worlds best defensive midfielder. lastly, pray tammy don't get in the way of Werner and Pulisic and it don't take 20 tries to get one on target.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I wanna see Mount's contract, maybe it has a clause that says he should play all the games. Almost everyone can be rested except for him",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Abraham has to be on bench and instead Giroud to start simply because Abraham does nothing in the field but just to fill the number to be 11. Useless striker,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Good line up, I think Giroud and Kobacic will be a good addition in second half. Lampard should be make sure that his team win the first half with a good goal margin.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
So what is jorginho and Tammy doing on the lineup? Lampard doesn't learn from his mistakes at all. No creativity or whatsoever in the midfield if jorginho is present. Westham will dominate the midfield against us. Lampard must be serious with his team selection.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What the hell is Jorginho doing on the pitch?? Why is Kovacic on bench?? Lampard is the problem why we are loosing...n,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I love it when the team sheet is announced.

I have a mental bet with myself about who everyone will moan about before I click the comments.

I thought Abraham but I see Mount is the name on everyone‚Äôs lips again. It‚Äôs been a while. Half you lot will never be happy.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I will not stop saying lampard his mount elder sister's boyfriend because I don't know why he cannot rest him and use other players to give us result we have better players on the bench make use of them learn from your mistake and do something new man,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Chelsea needs a good coach, how can you bench Giroud who always score. For Chelsea to win trophies, Lampard must leave.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What has happen to us. The more games I watch the more I see that the overall pace of the Chelsea play has completely gone! We used to pass and move so quickly. Soo boring and so what predicable. We no longer have a counter attack at all!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why Jorginho instead of Kovacic who was our best player last season?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"We r going to win no matter what, but I prefer Giroud over Abraham and we need ziyech back ASAP to form perfect trio with Warner and Pulisic",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
We need a top coach who raise the spirit of players and motivate them in order to be fully a title contender surely,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I thought lampard said we have to bounce back to winning way, what is relationship between jorginho and winning waysüòí",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Mendy needs a performance today last 2 games hes been a liability. At fault for the penalty at Everton and should of saved the one he got a hand to against wolves.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Different game, same experts, same rubbish to read. Are you people never tired to complain. Do you think you know better than Frank knows. Look at you and look at Lampard. Can you see difference? It is time to shut up.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Hope we adapt to amore fast way of passing, the ball with purpose and ugue",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"This man is playing to lose ü§£ .. it is more than evident that Tammy doesn‚Äôt have the skill capacity to influence a game or even benefit the team, why is he playing?",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Timo Werner is a central forward ,why is Lampard playing him on the flanks. Tammy should be substituted for Giroud we can't take favouritism no more. Mount always on the starting line up,he needs a breather",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Love how the Chelsea admin removed my post! Everyone is entitled to their own opinion,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Good line up, Giroud and Kobacic will be a good addition in the second half.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"If chelsea really wanted to win this game for me Giroud would av started ahead of Abraham ,then Kovacic would av grabbed Mount's and james to start ahead of the captain (Azpi)..this lineup may fail to give chelsea the expected results but chelsea win then it will be a suprise",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"The only good thing is Jorg5 in the starting eleven, Mount and Tammy shouldn't have started the game, instead gird and perhaps kovacic should have started,",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I would love to see kovacic on mount's place, mount on the right wing,werner as the striker abraham out.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Lampard came to his senses and realised Giroud is not a starter but a super sub , that's how he's best utilised we may not like it as fans but it's the truth. The dropping of Havertz sents a message to team no one is undroppable.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What is Mendy doing between the sticks ?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Chelsea should win please so that those United fans won't burst my ear with taunt üò¢üòî,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why start Abraham when Hudson odoi is back..
Frank lampard always doing some silly mistakes",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I like chelsea to lose this game to teach Lampard how to line up players ......on their natural positions!!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I wonder how many chances he creates, goals/assists he has for him to start every game as the teams number 10",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I've just finished taking my beer for the night. You never can tell what will happen watching Chelsea these days. They might ruin your appetite..
Just hope they get it right this night",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Honestly I hope this line up opens up a resolute Westham. We will keep possession for sure but will we breakdown their defence?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I don't know but I'm not just comfortable with this lineup!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"In this kind of game, what we need Mount for is not really hard work but creativity.. If Pulisic does not create anything, I really wonder where creativity will most likely come from. I think Mount in particular will need to convince us that he can create at atleast. Especially if Westham game plan is to pack bus, how then will hard work be needed.. That has been the cry and demand of many fans",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Lampard will always make excuses for why other players must rest, including Timo and Kai, but NEVER for Mount, who leaves his basic midfield role and thinks he is a striker.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Is Giroud not the striker that scored against Wolves? Is he not the striker that has scored 9 goals on his last 10 games his started. How does Mount get in ahead of Kovacic, yet Mount has a habit of disappearing like he did against Wolves.
When will Lampard realise Werner is struggling out wide and last and definitely least, why is Abraham still starting? I think Lampard is tired and is pushing to be sacked and just doesn't know how to say ""i cant do this""",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Giroud performs better as super sub, good selection gaffer.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Tammy will be eaten alive by their centre backs. Timo should play as centre forward, his ability to run behind those tall centre backs.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Y is lampard playing Werner as a winger when he shd play number 9. Pulisic shd play left wing ad odoi right wing,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"To be sincerely honest In my humble opinion without being sentimental and of course, without offending anyone who thinks differently from my opinion but rather looking into this critical issue with perspective distinction and without condemning anyone's point of view I honestly think and believe that I sincerely have nothing to say",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Don't think we're strong enough, thought he would of stuck with giroud, rest werner, & mount, kovacic for jorginiho only my opinion.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
We don't need Giroud to start. The man needs to be rested. For me this line up is spot on.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"So annoying to see jorginho playing as lampard then plays Kante out of position. Playing so many players out of position:

Pulsic
Werner
Kante
Dave",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I really don't understand this line up. If we should lose this match, we won't take it easy on Lampard",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"All the best Chelsea....i feel the pain to seen Uncle Giroud on the bench...anyway.
....",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Timo Werner, man you got to be the player we bought you for.
And please can someone tell Lampard that chances are created in the opposition box, not playing in your own half!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Timo waster I don't think he has been working on his finishing why, now if the defenders don't score then it means either we draw or lose why Chelsea front line aaa",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"This coach doesn't even listen to us, taking Timo to wing again and expect him to do well

Why not Pulisic Werner Odoi?

Or must Werner even start every match?

Why not Pulisic Tammy Odoi?

I'm sick and tired of this Lampard guy o",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What about James?. Is he injured?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"With Mendy and Timo starting, i don't see Chelsea winning this game. Lampard still finds it difficult to place a good team line ups.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Not satisfied with team selection
Hopefully we win because the three points is needed",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why Abrahamüò†, he is league one standard not premier league standard he is a waste of goal chances... Giroud is far better.. ....Hope we win the game.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"This mount that plays every single game and he plays full 90mins
Don't know am the only person seeing that guy always plays rubbish at the second half and lampard will never sub him ü§îü§î",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Despite all this negativity here. I see us winning big and bigger here. Come on blues,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
what the hell is Odoi and Giroud doing on the Bench? If we loose this match erhhh i'll be travelling to London from Cameroon to have a crisis dialogue with Lampard and the board.. Benching a Natural winger what for?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Sorry to say this,if the wingers are not performing the midfield should help,we lack midfielders that can shoot from outside the box,create killer passes,look at Bruno,debryneüòîüòî,oh God,and then we have kovacic that last scored 5years ago,jorginho that can't pass neither can he shoot",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why bench Havertz?
When players are struggling you don't bench them for the sake of their confidence. He needs time to adapt to the league but he won't adapt from the bench. Too bad Werner is on the flanks again but I hope Chelsea wins regardless of who ever is in the line-up. #KTBFFH üíô",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
About time Cesar back in the starting lineup far better defender than James,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What is impact of Mount on this game since,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Can we have our Hazard back in Podence of Wolverhampton in the Summer,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"whenever I see Abraham.... I fail to understand why Lampard prefer him to Giroud.........
Emerson should have started also..",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Can someone tell lampard to Think thrice before starting Tammy....,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Werner should take his role as no.9 point man. Lampard learn from history.
December has always been a struggling period for Chelsea fc.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Instead of utilising Hudson on the wing then put timo centre hes done it again well i hope we lose need a new manager,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Another fake line up. .what the hell is jorghino doing in that mid field...Werner out of position again... lampard out!ü•∂ü•∂,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
When is Mount going to take a Nap. ..üôÑ,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why does Mount start every single game ?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Today is the other night when we Chelsea fans shall have sleepless nights similar like gamblers doüòú,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"It‚Äôs not where we are now,it‚Äôs where we‚Äôll be at the end of the season that counts until then enjoy its only a game !!!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Tammy is lucky to be on the line up today he must show why he is better than giroud at the moment,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"the Mercato starts soon. the tracks for Chelsea: Pocchetino, Lucien Favre, Allegri",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Werner Still Out of position,....Wh
y not Odoi That Side?....And Abraham What For?",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I don't know what Abraham and Jorginho are doing on the field. They should have gone for early Christmas üò†,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Today is the game to confirm whether we have lost track in title chase,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why was Werner bought if our strikers were going to be Abraham and giroud.Why dont he try Abraham on the wings as he does to Werner every game this is very unfair.I never saw lampard playing defence or goalkeeping or striking at Chelsea.Abramov
ich please have your red pen close today.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Pulicic is never effective on the right....werner
is not a winger, everything seems wrong",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I'm not pleased with the selection Mr Lampard.
Why starting the attack with Abraham who has proven to be useless in the last 3 games?
Giroud has proven to be the main guy in the last few games and you benched him üò≤
Keeping Kovacic17 on the bench and starting with Jorginho5 is like playing another version of Havertz alongside Kante and Mount... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Since Callum is fit, why didn't you play him in RW and play Pulisic in the LW?

See what Burnley is doing to Wolves that dealt with us...
That shows it was very stupid of us to loose that game...

This is an important game which we need to win after we foolishly lost the last two and you choosed this players to start???

I hope we win this game üôè
Goodluck lads...",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Once you are a B.P patient please stay away from tonight match because as we can see our coach is a confuse man.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Thank God that harvarz is not in the line up.d line up is not bad, girioud can coming early second half to pair Abraham, James as well",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
3 england Players! Poor Line Up!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"One thing I love about Tammy he always silence his haters. We haven't lost a match whenever Tammy started. He defends, hustle for ball, assist and finally scores call him championship striker but he is better than our past strikers who wore no 9",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Lampard u just messed up;this was not what i was expecting,u've really dulled my spirit for this game . Jorginho starts! For a game like this; I expected Kovacic. Not only that I expected u to play werner as CF today and Anjorin as left winger. NO! NO! NO! Lampard u may cost us the title. Let see how ur game plan works.
#KTBFFH",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"2 loses and Lampard is already confused, he doesn't know which players to field",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why TIMO out of position?? HUDSON ODOI is available,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
How do u expect werner to play as 9 when our wingers are injured and not fit. Some people talk as if they don't watch football all u know is after the match the next thing is lampard out,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I'll just wait for the final score before I run my mouth...... I suggest you all do the same üòï,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Chelsea played badly..very lucky to get 3 goals at the death of the match.. majority of the match they played badly.if westham were a good team they would have equalized and probably taken the game away from Chelsea before those two late goals came in....wener has been the most wasteful striker or should I say unlucky striker in the premier league this season..he needs to start taking his chances and help Chelsea kill off games on time or else he will cost Chelsea loosing or drawing games they should have killed off,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Where have all these crybaby fake fans come from. Either you support the team which means you support all the players in the squad and the manager. If you can't do that go support someone else.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Without Giroud there is nothing we are going to do here,,,good night people.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Lampard bench harvetz, then mount at the mid but why?? Anyway goodluck",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I‚Äôm not complaining about the selection but I‚Äôd like to see us playing 4-3-3 with Kovacic in for Mount,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
This game we need strong playes like Giroud and Kovacic not Jorginho n Abraham,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Does anyone know of another Chelsea page I can follow that isnt full of plastic fans saying moronic rubbish like 'Drop Mount,' or 'Sack Lamps,'. So much anti English sentiment yet you say you follow an English team. So many muppets on here it's unreal.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why bench a striker thats way better than Abraham,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Wait who's watching this game what's the usefulness of Abraham,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
In league games with giroud possibilities of winning are always 0,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Very weak in the midfield nothing world class about it.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"If Lampard will one day be sacked by Abramovic I'll fully support that.
Lampard is digging his own grave
How can you bench Giroud for lazy Abraham",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Come on guys we have to win this. Blue is the colour,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why must Mount and Jorghino start Lampard lacks a game plan,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"They won't tell you that Mason Greenwood has more career goals than Pulisic.
The pain will remain in the rented stadium.
Mark this.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
All d EPL matches Giroud started we kept losing is good we use Abraham that makes us win each time he starts,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Guys, what is happening about KOVACIC, he mostly play from the bench this season. And he is one of our last season First Eleven player. He move forward with ball and he is a serious player but Lampard don't used to start him this season.
Maybe he's not from England",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Biggest mistake is Giroud on bench.... atleast captain America is in ....All the best Chelsea... waiting for lampards sacks news soon...no trophy can this guy will lift with such forcing players to perform yet without form but lefting good players outside eg Alonso .,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Very poor selection Abraham is very sluggish lampard should have Play werner 9,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Where is Papa Giroud? üòè,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
A good line up for Chelsea bt Lampard could Giroud more than Abraham,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Can anyone tell me what Werner is doing in Right wing? Why kovacic on bench. This is too much.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Lampard is a crazy coach ... What so good with mount ??! Zero goals , zero assist . Yet Chelsea number 10 choice??? . Tammy the falling striker üôÜ... Even if we win ,, we will struggle getting goals üò≠ . Mad lampard.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I understand that Giroud is a better sub but why is Kovacic on the bench?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Mount and Abraham don't deserves to play for Chelsea, they are both worst players at Chelsea. Don't know why Lampard is benching Giroud and Havertz",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
But why start this cabbege abraham will lose agian,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Today i will stop my support for the Blues our goals are different I want to win not to build someone that am not sure of his future,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I really do nit understand, we bought a scorer and he never plays in his position?",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"This is how to make Kai Harvetz grow.

Never start him... bring him on at 83 minutes when you are 3 up!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Chelsea will play better today without havertz and kovacic...frank
bring in pulisic and jorginio tammy...we have runners...can bring on giroud as a sub...good frank",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Meanwhile No one has scored more goals for us than Olivia Giroud Despite playing about Half the Minute of Timo Werner but ok sure Let's go back to the man Child Abraham... Lampard is obsessed with this Tammy of a guy,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Kovacic is is one of our best midfielder but he is always on the bench. If we don't win this game Frank will be in trouble,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I see Abraham in the starting line up, after all Lampard is a dog that always go back to its vomit.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Its a derby and its not gonna be easy But werner is a striker not a Winger.... It will be sad if we lose,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Don‚Äôt need Noble in the side... Bad enough we have that donkey Haller upfront. We have been playing with 10 men ever since Ant√≥nio got injured.. Need to buy a Striker in January!!!!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"Someone tell me why we have 2 keepers on the bench? Maybe one should start on the left instead of Fornals, or maybe Randolph up front for Haller‚öíÔ∏èüòÇüòÇ",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
Mark Noble hasn‚Äôt been good enough for the past 6 or 7 years. Let go of the great servant stuff. Being overran ever time in Midfield,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
How can Moyes select Fonals AND Noble ? They are the two weakest players in the squad. Frank Lampard must have licked his lips when he saw that team sheet. I really hope they both play brilliantly now and make me look a mug but I wont hold my breathe,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"Given the creative talent that we have in midfield, but puzzlingly on the bench this evening, Mark Noble, great servant or not, should not be starting. Period.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
Good team selection and solid. For me Benrahma didn't do enough in the last game. Bit too greedy and decision making was poor at times,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"Benrahma should be in for Noble, but given how much Moyes has improved the team spirit and work rate I‚Äôll trust his choice.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
Would like to think that one of the 3 center mids will bomb forward to help attack. You would think Soucek but I wonder if this is where we see Rice at his very very best? Look it may not be the best line up but I‚Äôm really beginning to get behind Moyes.. I hope he pulls a master stroke tonight ....COYI ‚öí‚öí‚öí,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"He‚Äôs looking to contain and draw or get a 1:0 win at best , tricky game, Chelsea have more options/ fire power , if we are losing at half time he may change up , if Yarma is fit he would be good option and Benrahma obvs ...I hope I‚Äôm wrong but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs got this right ...there‚Äôs always a set piece goal with WHU",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
He clearly wants the game to be played in the middle of the park and that is not a bad idea at all given Chelsea's strengths. I have no problem at all with that. COYI,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"Noble and Fornals FFS!
I'm sure Moyes will sub them both when we're 3-0 down.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"How does Fornals keep getting game time? Just coz he runs around? Watch him today, his passes will all be sideways or backwards. Declan Rice even is more attack minded then him",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs purely to use Soucek in a more advanced role in the box but I‚Äôd rather Benrahma than Fornals on the left. Counter attack would favour us in this sort of game.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
The way west ham play tonight ü§£ü§£,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"As much as I‚Äôm not pleased with Benrahma not starting, let‚Äôs give the coach the benefit of the doubt, he may have a good reason for not starting him.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"This is the main reading I have never rated Moyes!! Everyone going on about how well he‚Äôs got the team playing & we can anyone, so typical inconsistent Moyes with a chance to best Chelsea & move us up . He goes all negative. Sorry Moyes definitely no faith or confidence in you whatsoever!!!!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
Team selection looks like he‚Äôs looking to sit back but why isn‚Äôt there behnrama if he‚Äôs wanting to try catch them on the break.... mark noble was ovbs going to play to keep the team ticking over but all in all a team selection that‚Äôs going for a bore draw to me,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
I‚Äôd rather have a mannequin on a Segway driving in circles around the centre circle making random hopeless runs to close down the keeper and leaving a big hole behind than Noble starting; although the difference is negligible.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"Not a game for the Algerian, as cannot defend and bit of a luxury player but good as an impact player.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
Chelsea team full of pace. Our team not. Don't under stand why we haven't gone with wing backs. Just hope you've got it right Moyes. Let's hope it's a master stroke.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
Its embarrassing 2 keepers on the bench and the speed of noble,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
Are we really saying we don‚Äôt have a decent youth team player to get on the subs bench instead of Martin?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
Kind of seen this coming .. I read an article with Moyes claiming he didn't West Ham to prove what a good Manager he is ... Team suggests he is back to his arrogant best ... just need him to threaten a few woman with a slap now...... COYI,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
Noble?? No benrahma? Not feeling this game at all now,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
If we get a pen then noble can take it apart from that not sure about this lineup but moyes knows what he doing ?? Like to see Antonio back soon from injury we create more when he is in the side simples,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
Why ain't Benrahma playing instead of Noble? (I'm not Algerian by the way),133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"Why do we have two goalkeepers on the bench, it‚Äôs a little bit too negative for me tonight.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"We're gonna get ripped apart
How does Fornals keep getting a game?",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"Noble noooooooooo, been loving Moyes recently but this is bonkers. he should be nowhere near the starting line up üôàüôàüôà‚öí‚öí‚öí‚öí‚öí‚öí‚öí‚öí",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
I totally get that team..Benrahma is great to impact later and Noble knows what it is to sleeve up for a Derby.....,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Away,-3
"Expected line up except Davies instead of Delph. Hope he steps up and shows he‚Äôs he‚Äôs good enough although I have my doubts. Think Delph is not fully up to speed after long lay off.
Would love to see a clean sheet today!",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Up to Davies to put a performance in now, was expecting Delph but I trust Carlo to make the right move. COYB",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Last time we won 4 in a row we won the league didn‚Äôt we?????,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Well done lads, great performance. Special well done to Tom Davies who I thought had a really solid game, in the middle of the park and did well at right back too. Keep the boo boys quiet for a couple of weeks anyway.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Iwobe made a brilliant chipped cross to assist James‚Äô first goal of today‚Äôs brace. Both are playing well and aggressively, and making numerous skillful attacking threats.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"69th minute, at 3-1, NBC EPL commentator: ‚ÄúHats off to Tom Davies. Brilliant bit of defending there‚Äù as a saved shot 4 yards out and central in the goal about to be cleanly struck by an opponent was cleared by Davies. 70th minute: a brilliant crossing chip by Abdoulaye Doucour√© assists James Rodriguez to send Everton to a 4-1 lead, likely assuring Everton‚Äôs first top-flight season-opening 4 straight wins since their title-winning 1969/70 season.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"How long will they stick with Pickford, a total clown that will bring the rest of the lads down with his constant error after error, but they still play him, something wrong somewhere !!!",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Defensive options nearly non existent on the bench. Suppose that's why Davies is getting a chance. Makes sense as Bernard would make a better impact player if needed. Delph would be back up for Doucoure and Nkounkou can slide in at left back if Digne needed at center back. Hope the boys stay focused in this one... COYB...,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"I'd love to know what Tom Davies does in training to keep getting picked when shirt available obviously because for me he offers nothing in the game..never a forward pass,an attacking run,shot on target or assists for others..It's something that baffles me..Hopefully an win today tho blues even with him in the team..UTFT.NSNOüíô",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Davies should be shown the door, constantly loses the ball in our third, responsible for god knows how many goals against last year, get rid",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Really want Tom to do well but gives the ball away too much for me and largely ineffective.tha
t said let‚Äôs get behind him he might surprise us all ü§îüíôüíô",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Hope we get lucky here and get a superb performance from Tom today, otherwise losing Allan will be hugely felt. Fingers crossed ü§û. COYB!",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Feel so down !!! I honestly hoped I would never witness Tom Davies and Sigurdsson in the same Everton side ever again. Oh Well, lets hope its not a recurring situation, and that we somehow manage to sneak three points today.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"I do hope tom davies plays well today and prove some doubters wrong. But we have to get behind carlo and his decision. Glad richarlison is fit to play. Trossard and maupay have been playing well for brighton, must keep them quiet today. Siggy pull some magic today. Doucoure same again from you in midfield, and the front 3 speaks for itself üî•üî•üî•. 3 points is a must. Keep it going toffees üíôüíôüíô",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"I'd personally have Delph holding and Bernie in the free role.
But I'm not Carlo so will believe in his choices and hope.
I'll be all over this if Davies and Siggy have stinkers though üòÇüòÇ.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
In carlo you should all trust if he chooses davies then he knows better than anyone on here thats why hes a winner a serial winner,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Davies is in the team because he earned it in training. Carlo said it‚Äôs training that gets a player picked. Davies has had a bad 12 months since he broke onto the scene but he‚Äôs a blue and Carlo wouldn‚Äôt pick him if he didn‚Äôt believe in the lad. Look what he did with Bolasie. Let‚Äôs trust our amazing manager,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Get behind the team before you start moaning players are playing who you wouldn‚Äôt pick! Carlo picked them it‚Äôs his choice not yours after all we‚Äôve won every game this season and still the negativity!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Sorry but i would not let Davies near the squad, nowhere near good enough the way we are playing.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Goes to show that missing one vital player (Allan) can change the dynamics of the whole team. Anyway, Davies will need to prove himself today because i don't think he'll get many more chances this season. COYB",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Honestly, Tom Davies in the team is a complete joke I don‚Äôt care if he scores six or has a stinker or he is a local lad- he has proved over 100 games that he simply isn‚Äôt good enough.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Great to see the support from our brilliant fans slagging one of our players off before the game has even started, pure kopite behaviour!",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Looks a good solid side Davies is a bit of a worry for me but he might try today I like sigurdsson and hope he can pull of some magic and I would love to see Pickford have a good game today,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Carlo angel lotto has managed some of the best players and teams in the world and obviously feels Davies can do a job for us today so I‚Äôd rather go with his judgement on mine and likewise I‚Äôm sure he will whip him off too if he‚Äôs not doing what Carlo asks for,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Delph had to start over Davies. I can't see any place for Davies in the squad moving forward,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Well at least we have that front 3 and the energy of dacoure in midfield so a comfortable winüëç,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"For all you Davies knockers, he must be doing something right in training. I know he has a good attitude so you have to trust Ancellotis judgement. These anti Davies fans have probably moved on to Davies after they were proved wrong about DCL",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"From a Brighton fan, best of luck today to Everton. Great to see you guys having such a good start to the season. If we can avoid gifting you silly goals and not hit the post 5 times then this should be a brilliant game. I think it‚Äôll be a close one. If we come away with a point I‚Äôll be delighted.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Yes, it‚Äôs Tom Davies and we all have our opinions on him ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è BUT, one person doesn‚Äôt make a team win or lose, it‚Äôs a team game and I‚Äôm sure other players will up their games if needs be to cover for him, so let‚Äôs just get behind them and cheer them on üëäüèª COYB üíô",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Tom Davies and Sigurdsson together is going to provide nothing!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
I wonder if the people knocking Davies are the same ones who slated DCL last season . ü§î,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Stop the negatively people lads get behind the players tom Davis is not the best but he is an Everton player,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"We are at home so pick an attacking line up, Bernard should be ahead of Davies, he can't do anything productive!! Disappointing",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
I‚Äôd have played Delph before Davies!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Just when I was starting to sober out they put bloody Davies in the team, 50 mins to KO better start on the lager now FFS.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Hope Davies and Sigurdsson play complete blinders to shut us all up but I just can‚Äôt see it from Davies. Siggy has it in his locker for a worldy goal or a bit of magic from a set piece but I fear Davies is well out of his depth. I hope I‚Äôm proved completely wrong and the lad plays brilliantly. We shall see. COYB!! üíôüëäüèª,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"I bet Tom Davies can't wait to get on the pitch with all the support he gets from our own fans ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, in Carlo we trust. COYB!!!!!!!",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
That central midfield is worrying. Doucoure got a lot on. Need to see Mina put in a performance with the new signing imminent. Great to have competition and starting players need to step upüíôüíôüíô,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

"We need to be careful today, Brighton battered United last week!",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Davies instead of Delph is a weird one. Doucoure has to be on it today because Davies runs round like a headless chicken, doesn't tackle anyone and gives the ball away.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Well Brighton have a chance üò¢ Let's hope he can actually find a blue shirt today, and not give any silly fouls away outside our box.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Even played Bernard in middle before davies,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Glad to see Davies get a start! Really think Carlo will get the best out of him and help him become the player we know he can be!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
I just don‚Äôt get it how on Earth is Davis playing he offers us nothing in midfield,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
All good .. but why Davies and not Delph or Bernard ...,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"The team must be aiming for a win, but should also be vary of complacency. Plus trossard needs to be kept on a check.

Nearly every comment below is of pure shock or about Tom Davies or both ü§¢ü§Æ my stomach actually turned when I seen he was anywhere near that team,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
One of the reasons klopp has done well is he has his players playing like a gang of mates who'll die for each other. Now Carlo has got an everton team who appear to be like this ( but with more talent) so can WE become part of this team and if you must critisize make it constructive!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Playing in team with confidence and better players, hopefully bring the best out of Davies, just get behind Carlo‚Äôs selection COYB",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Top of the league in these days
Then what?

"Hmm would have Delph in front of Davies who gives up possession far too easily. Brighton are going to make the middle a battle and you can't gift the ball at this level.
But - In Carlo we trust üíôüíô",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Davies needs to step-up today. Sig has looked decent lately but Davies makes me nervous everytime he's in the team. Gotta trust in Carlo though, hopefully another win today.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

Come on . Be objective. Tom Davies simply can‚Äôt make it at this level. Delph would have been a better starter. üòÉ,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Won‚Äôt be long until delph gets subbed on for davies,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Delph or Bernard should have been picked ahead of Davies,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
How about people stop complaining about the line up and just back the team!It is a squad after all and not just 11players,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Davies has nothing to lose, everything to gain.. have some faith.. hopefully I‚Äôm not eating these words at FT",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

Can the back up brigade deliver? Acid test today...won‚Äôt be a walk over.,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Massive game for Davies today. Would imagine Doucoure will drop back to DM with Davies taking the 8 role. No Kean? Is he injured or on his way out?,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

I would have played Bernard instead of davies myself he has abit more to offer.,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

Time for a rethink albion start at the back Ryan is not a premium goal keeper to survive this season he must be replaced 10 goals in 3 games no good enough then we need a top defensive coach at the moment they look a defensive rabble players going to ground to quick goal keeper with no positional sense and lucky if he ever leaves the ground Think long and hard or you will will be relegated this season I only hope I am wrong good luck you are going to need it,34,Everton,Brighton,Away,-2

We dont even have a tactic. Looks like we play for fun.,34,Everton,Brighton,Away,-2
That performance was a disgrace. No heart. Technically inept all over the pitch. Last two home games were relegation form. Not one player can walk off that pitch with pride. Utter garbage,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"godfrey has played well but we need more attacking threat today from full backs so understandable to play coleman and digne
midfield is more offensive so should improve us offensively and on paper it seems logical to do that against a poor newcastle team but time will tell.
we certainly need a new striker or wide offensive player to come in to give us more options and would be better keeping bernard until end of season send gordon out on loan instead he has not played particularly well in the few opportunities he has had lately he has ability though and needs more game time at another team.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Looks like all out attack today, these are the sort of games we need to win by 4 or 5 goals we always seem to win by the odd goal.COYB. Looking at the banch I think Bernard and tosun may be off in the next few days",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Strong side. Happy with that. We have to be on top of our game today, can‚Äôt be too complacent against bottom side teams. Must win. James to be MOTM and DCL and richarlison to score. Hopefully clean sheet and pickford to come back strong after what happened the other night. COYB üíôüíô",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Why is Pickford still playing after another howler on Wednesday when we have a great backup in Olsen,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Look at that bench, if ever a team needed more forwards...as for Pickford, support him or support someone else! I see no one‚Äôs really questioning why DCL & Richy start after not scoring those chances v Leicester",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Looking forward to seeing us beat the toon it's a good line up to play resting Godfrey and Holgate will be ok we have strength in defence my only concern is pickford he doesn't do well against them would have liked olsen in goal,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
See our squad needs 1 or 2 players in by Monday otherwise we are going to struggle if injuries take over,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Bernard and Tosun üëã don‚Äôt mind Godfrey on the bench boys, give the kid a rest. This Newcastle team is gonna sit and we need Luca‚Äôs running in behind to open doors. Ben is a better defender but shite going forward without acres of space in front of him to kick and run like forest gump! Shouldn‚Äôt say shite really, just not as good as Digne at it! COYB!!!!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Interesting bench and tells you hopefully what you need to know on the Bernard and Tosun front. Finances must come first during the pandemic (especially considering the deadwood that's still being subsidised / paid off) and with Allan (Gbamin eventually more for next season and Delph) back soon it's a solid 15 or so first team but really hope we can pick up another number 9 on loan come the close of Monday (Dzeko) and then sort out Kean / permanent replacement in the summer (plus a solution to the long term RB).,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Strong team , Allan back for Man Utd game , 3pts has to be a must against a poor Newcastle team , striker still needed by the end of monday , any injury to Calvert-Lewin could ruin a European spot !!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Believe Bernard, Tosun, and Lossil are all on their way out before Mondays deadline, hence the lack of options on the bench. Would have thought any spaces could be filled by some of the U23's for the experience?",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Attacking lineup today, not a lot of pace but a lot of creativity. COYB üí™",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"We've just played one of the poor teams in the league and they made us look like a bang average team. On Newcastles first goal we had all eleven players in the box. Their best player is left unmarked and not a single player near either posts. Overall a really bad performance
If we keep playing in such a negative manner we've no chance of European football.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Knew he'd select Pickford. Hope he doesn't live too regret this. Not happy.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Not sure what Pickford has to do to get dropped but like the rest of it, although holgate and Godfrey unlucky right decision we need full backs who will get forward and create chances, dcl will benefit",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"He keeps experimenting with the midfield. Keeps getting caught out too. Godfrey, Holgate and Gomes unlucky to miss out. Richy lucky to keep his place.
This will either work and we will score 4 or 5 or we could end up being embarrassed.
Lucky that Carlo is the expert and hope he has got it right.
COYB.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Dont mattter what team you play, ref was awfull, James get grabbed by the neck by shelvy and pulled over, it was a perfessional foul around 15th minute shoud have been a yellow. The ref then allows another 5 tackles each one on James before given a yellow card, yet carded 3 Everton players on their first foul. That changed the match. We didnt play great, but then when your play maker is taken down 3 times by the same person and 5 times in the first half, what can you do.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
So he drops our best player in Godfrey n keeps the clown in goal god sake carlo let's hope this is not another defeat,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Strong line up, good to have Doucoure back but we do need a striker, another threat...we‚Äôre very predictable. Should be 3pt COYB üíô",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2

Need a much improved performance from the Leicester game. If Pickford has another shocker he needs to be dropped. Delph is back in training but pity he won‚Äôt be in any shape to be sold by Monday. COYB,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
I get Godfrey not playing hopefully this is just a rest for the lad. Pickford. Mmmm always looses his head against Newcastle.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Considering its supposed to be an attacking line up we haven't done much attacking, Iwobi and Richarlison both shite, haven't seen them go past their man or put a decent cross in yet, no wonder DCL is frustrated, playing one of the worse teams in the league and making them look good, absolute tripe.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Some people are never happy.. after the valuable point against title contenders Leicester all we need is a win today to shut some mouths our season is still good,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"That team should be more than good enough to beat Newcastle,good to make some changes as we have 3 big games in the next 12 days so good to make use of the squad but no excuses today,Newcastle

"Very weird to see Godfrey on bench, probably just resting. In Carlo we trust, COYB!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
We are lazy. No pace. I saw the stat of most distance covered and 4 out of 5 players were Newcastle. Why? Why? Why? Are the players told not to run? Or is it they just can‚Äôt be arsed?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2

"Awful performance, not enough creativity, and key player are poor. We need quality additions and get rid of overpaid players like Gylfi. Golden chances missed yet again, Everton that!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Harsh on Godfrey but a rest will do him good plus he has played more games than he expected to this season.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"I‚Äôm sure Carlo has some psychological masterplan with two keepers, but squad clearly lacking attacking depth. Hopefully a surprise before Monday please!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
you will never win a game when you have a throw in 3/4 up the pitch and the ball finds its way back to the goalie!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Looks like Godfrey is going to have to turn in to a right back to get a game. Good team but 2 GKs and 3 defenders on the bench shows how short the squad is,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"We don't have a hope in hell of getting into Europe playing football like that. We are crying out for a wide player with pace. We are too slow all over the park
Sorry Carlo but that just isn't good enough for us. I hope there is a player or two lined up otherwise it's about 7th or 8th at the end of the season.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2

"Thought this would be line up, only contentious one is Godfrey, he has been a revelation, that team is gonna win today COYB",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Sadly you knew Newcastle were gonna score....and we‚Äôre not going to reply by the sound of it. I won‚Äôt be looking at the comments in 15 minutes....,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Everyone knocking the team selection. Cmon He's obviously decided for more attacking play with the two wing backs bringing Coleman back in, pushing the ball forward then moving Rodriguez into the middle of the park Need to get some crosses into the box and we could be looking at a big win",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
I think the only thing that could let that team down is Pickford. Let‚Äôs hope not,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"lack of intensity, look more for the opposing goal if they want to qualify a cup, how is it possible that the forwards cover the goalscorer of the opposing team",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Yeah glad pickford is in goal got both teams to score Everton win ofcourse and with butter fingers in goal could come in,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"No striker on the bench. Dont worry, no doubt in my mind Godfrey could come on and do a good job as centre forward.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Sitting here with a beer, nervously anticipating Pickford chucking another one in.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Can't believe Godfrey is not playing..,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Sigurdsson over gomes is odd, otherwise good side an should be 3 points.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Agree with lineup apart from Pickford Olsen should start this one,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Attacking line up.

Going for the throat",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"To be honest a good team to put out, but we will see, can only hope and keep fingers crossed from now until end of season... COYB",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Games r coming thick and fast so get the rotating players to keep them fresh. Man utd and spurs coming up hes doing the right thing in my opinion.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Would love to see Godfrey at lb and Digne ahead of him .
Would give great balance to the team",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Pickford gets wound up easily playing Newcastle probably should have rested him today,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Pickford needs to shine today. This could be last chance saloon for the keeper,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"We were like a blunt knife, that couldn't even cut threw some melted butter, no attacking threat what so ever... We should try and sell sigurson by Monday, utter garbage on 120k a week...",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Very surprised Godfrey on bench he‚Äôs been outstanding,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
What a surprise.. slack off & let Newcastle grow in confidence.. üôÑ,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
I know said we not signing anyone but surely we need a striker not one on bench and take it tosun and Bernard off,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Thought Carlo would have picked Olsen in goal but how many more chances will Pickford get until he gets dropped to the bench? Pickford does seem to try and pull off Hollywood style saves but he's still adept at making mistakes every other game,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Pickford was always going to play as thats a managers way of saying he backs him. I bet pickford is rated next game,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
So lossl goes and we still put 2 keepers on the bench?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Expect Rodriguez to score and also give an assist ü§ó,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
That bench is not offensive at all,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
This is terrible. One of the worst performances ive seen in a while. Just have nothing to give. Everyone looks lost,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Just need to find our man , work that pass in and find out the right pass ball , iwobi digne esp.. but we are doing the right work .. James knows !",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Where is the Tosun14?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"I‚Äôd have dropped Pickford, I think he needs a few games off.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
We've got to cut a squad that has TWO keepers on the bench and NO strikers...ü§Ø Only Everton,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Pickford and Coleman. Jesus are we gifting them the win.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
attack minded team but delivery on the pitch is non existent. Poor performance so far,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Good team selection, a bit hard to see Godfrey on the bench he has been playing good football, who would you take off for him ? Iwobi ... ?",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"I'm happy with the team. Lucas digne on the LW wasnt the answer...richar
lison needs to be closer to DCL....godfrey will just be rested",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Wow Ben on the bench that‚Äôs a bad call imo he‚Äôs been immense but can afford to rest him against these suppose,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Honestly thought Pickford would of been dropped today.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
2 keepers on the bench and pickford shouldn't even be starting.got to give olsen a deserved run in the side,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Lewin nowadays not scoring a goal today he will score two goals,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"I prefer Olsen, but Ancelotti knows what he is doing. Looks winnable.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Are bench is getting worse ....need center forward not 2 keepers.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Don‚Äôt underestimate this one...

I think Holgate or Godfrey will be used...",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
2 keepers on the bench again. Virginia instead of lossle this time. Only a small gripe but I find it odd.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Look at that bench its woefull we need signings!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Please top up thinking player in our team....
Why Bernard not in Ancelotti plan?",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
How‚Äôs Pickford kept his place?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Very defensive minded today, three keepers?",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
What's with 2 keepers yet no striker on bench,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Great selection come on Pickford & Sigurdsson ‚öΩ,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"useless as an ashtray on a motorbike, paid too much, no hearf, let big dunc sort them out.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Best team in a long while. Close to our best except for Allan missing!!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Easy man to easy üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ poor Pickford üòÜ double this season over him and Carlo magnifico üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Graeme Jones black and white army ‚ö´‚ö™,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Why is Pickford in goal?? üò°üò°üò°,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
No Pickford Kenny or Gordon .Injured or out on loan,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Carletto si no hay posesion deben tener definicion. No pueden perder las oportunidades que generan. Hay que meterla. En los contragolpes hay que llegar hasta el arco., absurdo que los pierdan por un p√©simo pase teniendo un jugador libre para recibir. Levanten la cabeza!!!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
No striker on the bench ?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
We need more attacking options for the bench.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
no idea coach from everton...ssme old stlye .,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Aslong as we don't sit on a 1-0 lead and play like the 2nd half against Leicester. Come on Everton!!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Will Richarlison play football today?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Glad Davies isn‚Äôt starting, baffled why pickfords starting?",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Attack attack!
The polar opposite to the Leicester game.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
I could donate empty bucket . It will be better in goal than Jordan Pickford,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Good team! Kept the core of the team but with some good rotation with a busy schedule ahead UTFT üíô,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Godfrey doesn‚Äôt deserve to be dropped , has been star quality so far.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Why have two GK on the bench?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Very very poor bench should have more faith in Bernard Tosun and Kean,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Very attacking line up üëç,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Proper banana skin game for us today.... anyone needs to win a game or a player needs to score after a bad run it usually happens against us ..... hopefully not today,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Final 30 secs and ball gets passed backwards. Unbelievable wrong attitude,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Nice to see us attacking from the off,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Great team. We are just missing aƒ∫lan,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Absolute embarrassment today, no desire, no tactics, no bench, not good enough",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
An attacking line up...COYB,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Can‚Äôt Believe The Team Carlo has Picked , Pickford üò± No Godfrey üò± Don‚Äôt say he Needs A Rest .",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
A lot of pressure on Jordan today.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"I thought Olsen would of been on to be honest, so I hope Pickford does a good job today.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
That's a strong Everton line up,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Ya sacaron al 17, para cuando el 7??? que jugador para acabar con los avances, me pregunto: Cuanto le paga el 7 a Ancelotti para que li deje jugar?",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
low class team...a fashion shows team only...losing to newcastle,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Attacking team that! COYB üíô‚öΩÔ∏è,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
3pts is an absolute must today if want to stay in amongst it. Play at pace and go at them from the off.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Come on sigurdsson and doucoure get involved. Losing the midfield.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"very positive that, Newcastle fans are all saying that they are playing their slowest midfielders all at once.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Get rid of richarlisson boy what a mess! Barbaric footballer almost everythings he touches turns into shait,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Pickford is a liability,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Pickford, digne, sigurdson p√©simos restan no aportan nada",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Se nota que Carletto reflexion√≥ sobre el partido anterior y quiere salir a jugar buen f√∫tbol de ataque vs Newcastle,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Good 11 bench not great now tho,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Crap line up Godfrey at rt back holgate as sweeper,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Good change. Gomes was overrun by LCs midfield.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Disgraceful performance, should read the riot act on them all! Not acceptable!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Iwobi doucoure middle of the park plenty of legs,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
We need a striker on bench just in case,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"No bernard on the bench he must be on the way out with tosun, cant believe godfrey on bench but then again keane and mina have been solid at centre half and digne is better then godfrey bombing down the left and a better crosser",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2

Richarlison not good and too many times. New forward nerds,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Really wanted to see Olsen get some game time,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"3 points comfortable win, nothing else",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2

Shelvey and hendrick nightmare paring in CM? We will get over run with out doubt,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Id rather Krafth or Clark play CM than hendrick ffs, he offers absolutely nothing and certainly can't control the centre of the pitch ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Well they‚Äôve clearly took a strong hand on jokelinton breaking the rules, think making him watch us is a massive punishment üòÇüòÇ",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Not to mention the 5-4-1 and not starting ASM, he does not have much more he do quality wise. If he didnt lose the dressing room and had more passion and desire he can pass to the players however, we would be a top half team.... Bottom of the Top Half but scrape 9th 10th place",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Starting with 10 men again I see. Am I missing something? I know I should be supporting the team etc.....but what is Hendrick contributing. I know we haven‚Äôt got massive squad depth but surely he‚Äôs had enough chances and someone else worthy of a chance by now.
If St Maximam is fit enough for the bench then he‚Äôs fit enough to start, even if only for an hour....he will contribute more within that hour then any other player at the club, it‚Äôs so Frustrating supporting this club!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"I am honestly past caring... we will without doubt be fighting in the bottom 3 soon.
I cannot see a way out of this like. League 1 here we come",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Lewis and Hebdrick aren't good enough.... So please prove me wrong.

1st time we've had a relatively settled starting 11.

Still if we don't start to win. What is the chuffin point in Steve Roger Bruceü§î???

His job must be hanging by the last few threads",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Does this bloke never learn? Went 4 at the back second half against Leeds, play well. Back to a back five the next game. Nice one üëç",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
This is the day we show the premier league what we‚Äôre about. We‚Äôve had good preparation for today and we‚Äôve dusted ourselves down,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Jeff Hendricks? I hope he has the game of his life today. Come on Newcastle.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Keeping playing Negative football with this 5-4-1 that isloates Callum sometimes. I would rather take off Hendricks, bring hayden into midfield along with Shelvey and start Saint Allan Maximin on the left wing with Almion on the right and Joelinton behind Wilson. The team needs goals",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Bruce just can't help himself. Says he wants to play further forward and more attacking and then does the opposite.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"That's a unbalanced side if hes going to play with 3 up front as the Chronicle is predicting.

If we are playing 5 at the back that means hayden is a centre half? It's a losing team again.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"5-4-1. When will Bruce ever learn ffs. Darlow in goals again, and the useless Hendrick. Looks like Ritchie is on his way, hasn‚Äôt even made the bench, the lad is a grafter and leader and has given us so much. Awful signings from Bruce, playing them only shows how much worse we are under him.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Here we go again.... defend for 75 minutes, won‚Äôt come off our own box and hope we don‚Äôt concede.

Bring ASM on with 15 min to go, but too late as we‚Äôll have conceded too many by then and game will be dead!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Unbelievable. Really is. Surely he's fit enough to start??? Changed the game against Leeds. He must have 70mins in him. He only runs forward ASM,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"The man is a complete and utter ü§°. Set up for another defeat absolutely clueless St Maximum benched why am i suprised.Cabbag
e Heed taking us to loss number 12 sack him ffs.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Ah yes, the ever mobile central midfield partnership of Hendrick and Shelvey once more. I give up, he‚Äôs never going to get it is he ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Thats a Losing Side. we need Hayden in Central Midfiled with Shelvey. Clark at the Back in Defence With Lascelles . Well done Steve Keeping the loosing Form Going .. Mike Ashley Book Him a Taxi For Gods Sake...,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
We have got to start Playing Matty Longstaff in the Centre of Midfield with Isaac Hayden instead of Jeff Hendrick and Jonjo Shelvey because they have not been good at all for our one and only Mighty Toon this Season so Far and they need to Learn from the Mistakes that have cost us Matches but it‚Äôs Belta that Callum Wilson Ryan Fraser and Miguel Almiron are Starting for our one and only Mighty Toon Army 12:30PM VS Everton Away at Goodson Park on BT Sports but Hopefully we see our other main man/ Match Winner coming off the Bench in the Second Half Allan Saint Maximin HWTL Forever And Always UP The Mighty Mags For Life ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Why is Clark not in defence this is a must if fit ??
Why is maxim not playing instead of shelvey or hendrick with Hayden in there
Why is dubravka not given a game
This is an absolute joke he cannot be listening to anyone why employ staff who cannot do their job
I give up honestly",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Do you think Bruce realizes that getting this new coach in has put him in a no win situation? (Not that winning is a thing he does). If we win, new guy can take the credit. If we keep losing, Bruce is out.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
How many more games do we have to lose before he is sacked? He is just not up to the task.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
What‚Äôs the odds on 12 without a win and Bruce still in a job,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Why Matty is not in is beyond me... Shelvey actually shows up for a half but to me that isnt enough to justify his general lack of effort. Hendricks is a ghost, id rather the two Longstaffs. Hayden is actually decent on the ball, a waste so deep. Clark should be in.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"A don‚Äôt get why Hayden is centre half he‚Äôs been one of our most consistent players if there is any gives us strength in midfield compared to hendrick and shelvey they get bossed every weekend, ano we‚Äôve got injuries but if Clark is on the bench get him on",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"He needs to take Darlow out of that goal or we will never win a game, dubravka a must better keeper and we are better defensively with him in goal as well",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Newcastle United by the time the ‚Äúsale ‚Äú of club goes through or even materialise‚Äôs we will be in league 1 , same team for weeks and we keep getting thrashed ! Is anyone at this club watching these games ??? You as a club from top too bottom are making a laughing stock out of us as supporters! When covid is over don‚Äôt be surprised if SJP is empty!!! You brought this on yourselves!!!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Lascelles our worst centre back over Clark probably our best centre half,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Yes we are not the best squad, but I‚Äôm so pleased that all of you doubters on here have been proved wrong.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Not a Newcastle fan but Steve Bruce needs to go otherwise I can't see anything but relegation, Newcastle are a big team and should be in the premiership.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Doesn't really matter what side is put out, same people will complain either way. üò¥üò¥ Boring. We don't, all of a sudden have a new squad of players.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Looks as though Toon have found a good coach, well done Bruce.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Darlow has made enough mistakes last 2 3 games and should be dropped Dubravka should be back to number 1,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Playing with ten men again by starting Hendrick can he not see he offers absolutely nothing,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Why not play players in their proper positions. 5 at the back defend defend concede then try and play when it's already game over.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Hope this is steve Bruce's last game in charge how does he think setting up like that with almost the same players as always will work the guys a clown and acts like a big baby in interviews worst gaffer of my lifetime that's for sure,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"4231
Dubravka
Manquillo Schar Clark Lewis
Hayden Shelvey
Fraser Miggy ASM
Wilson
That‚Äôs my ideal lineup and formation",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Are people for real about darlow?! Hands down our player for the season! Dubravka possibly the better keeper overall but if anyone deserves to keep his place its darlow. In no way is he responsible for the state we are in,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Strap yourselves in for another swashbuckling 90 minutes from our dynamic duo of Shelvey and Hendrick.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Why ü§£ surely are best line up would be:

Manquillo schar lascelles Clark
Hayden shelvey

Or replace shelvey with matty long staff as shelvey has been poor lately and moves like a bus ü§£",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Has he learned nothing from that 2nd half he raved so much about ffs,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
I hope Hendricks forgotten his invisibility cloak today the cheeky little Potter,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
How are shelvey and hendrick still getting a start?! They‚Äôve been horrendous every week!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Honestly. Bruce is amazing.... ""gloves are off"" he said..... thr only hope we have is waiting for ASM to step on the pitch.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
What does Hendrick hold over cabbage heed to get in the team üò°,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Why is hendrick starting?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

Why is Hendrick in the side at all?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"If it doesn't work,don't try to fix it.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Clark at CB move Hayden to midfield with Longstaff, get Shelvey and Hendrick out of the team",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"How does Lewis/shelvey/
Hendrick keep getting picked? Clark should be in at CB and move Hayden to CM and get rid of hendrick. Maximin mustn‚Äôt be fully fit yet then üò≥",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Good to see the club has actioned measures for Joelinton for breaking covid rules , are and by the way your in the squad today ü§¶",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Another team sent out together behind the ball and defend with your life Chance of a goal for us today none unfortunately I predict 3-0 Everton I pray I am wrong,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Also I'm pretty sure they say that you have to be properly mental to do the same thing over and over again and expect a different outcome.....,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Starting with Hendrick the Ghost again might as well play with 10 men,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Pretty much same team week in an out that keep losing we need this mixed up,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"I‚Äôd go with a 4-2-3-1 with this team:
Darlow
Yedlin Schar Clark Ritchie
M. Longstaff Hayden
Murphy Saint-Maximin Fraser
Wilson

I tried to pick the team based on who was available or I believed was before they posted the team and on performances throughout the season.

Definitely drop Lascelles as keeps losing possession too much recently and Shelvey too, one good performance against Leeds doesn‚Äôt make up for the rest of the season. Since Ritchie ain‚Äôt in the squad not sure who I‚Äôd bring in for him at LB.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Another strange team and formation playing a little better but not enough to win,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

Pointless again he‚Äôs not got a clue defending defending defending. Might as well not turn up.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Cabbage heed will wait till it‚Äôs 3-0 then send on our World class attacking midfielder ASM to destroy Everton in the last 20mins.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

"I rather be whipped for 90 minutes than watch this team one more game. Worst owner, worst manager and shittiest squad in the league.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

Hendrick out Maxi in and it would change the dynamic of the game completely,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

"Needs to be hayden m. Longstaff and Anderson in center mid, surely they would at least put a effort in getting back and closing down.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

I like the front 3 and the keeper. It‚Äôs the players in between that are the problem!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
I can see 3 points today... Everton will take all 3!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Honestly drop manquillo into be right back role. Put Hayden in center midfield and ASM on the wing drop Hendrick to bench. How hard is it to play players in their positions for Christ sake cabbage head,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

Our midfield is too weak without Hayden. Hendrick is so negative and Shelvey to slow and lazy. Cannot see anything changing here sadly.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

ASM in for Hendrick would be nice to see us really go at another team from the start not when we are down with 20 mins left need to start on the offensive.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
How the F does Hendrick keep getting picked and how has Brainless Bruce not been sacked. As a long time supporter I am beginning to hope we go down if it gets rid of pie face and the FCB.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Does the back five just give shelvey and Kendrick an excuse for being so effing lazy,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
How does Hendrick get in ahead of Matty Longstaff?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

"So murphy out despite him being one of the only players who performed well?.. understandable,

"FFS. Just the one change!! 2 or 3 down in 60th minutes. makes a couple of subs, we play better for a while, might score a goal and then cabbage head will say he saw enough effort and spirit to encourage him. Its like Groundhog season as a Toon fan.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Ritchie not in the bench that‚Äôs him away to bournemouth,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Surely when we're beaten today, Bruce has to go?",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Shelvey and Hendrick again. Why doesn‚Äôt he ever learn and adapt. Get out our club.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

You can only pray thats a 4 3 3 but we all know Hayden is playing CB so be a 541. 25% possession and a comfortable win for Everton,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
They started putting Hayden in that first 3 or 4 names just to have people bite on it being 5 at back bow they clearly know hes not playing there,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
4 attacking players on the bench and 1 on the pitch.....,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Seriously we may as well start with 9 than put Hendrick and shelvey in. Worst I've ever seen in the black and white.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"We have change, why always 4-4-1 why not change and last i want see passion, many idea .... I don't see 1 game walking in the park.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

"Can Ciaran Clark not play left back ?
Or anyone else at all, come to that, ahead of Lewis ?",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
What is this absolute muppet doing? My good god! Hendrick and shelvey start again üòÇüòÇ 3/4-0 to Everton,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

The issue with Sean Longstaff must be still going on,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
Still starting with Hendrick and Lewis. Drop both for Ritchie and Matty Longstaff. Brucey masterclass.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Were gonna play for the draw ... probably be 2-0 down at half time and then 65th min bring on max for Ryan Fraser ... might get a lucky goal for 2-1

So pleased he‚Äôs playing 5-3-2 again. It‚Äôs been working so well,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2
"Jesus christ Hendrick again but no Murphy, Murphy is probably the best crosser of the ball and why no maximam again when hes fit",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,2

Turbulent times in Dortmund but a great season until now from Liverpool.
Sorry to hear that Mr. Jota is also injured but the boss is the man with the plan and the squad is still world-class and so i think it will be difficult for Fulham today.

See how it goes... I really hope Pablo gets a look in tonight. I really think he can unlock the opposition as good as any player in that league.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Being a Geordie and a Leeds fan since 1972 this is ferkin amazing result.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
The W looks very pretty in this column for sure. I think we played well after conceding the first goal.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Wow great 4th and 5th goals hope the leeds have used up the weekly goal quota for sunday,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Bielsa knows best but personally was looking for him to freshen it up a bit more, Poveda in for Harrison, leif left back, Strujik CB add some height to set pieces",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Good to see Costa nowhere near after that last game. Shambles of a performance.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Good to see Pablo back in the mix. Would love to see him come on and make an impact late on. Think that‚Äôs going to be his role!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"No Idea how Harrison is starting again after the three last games? Would have started PH and leif davis needs to change the team, hopefully wrong MOT",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Don't get a result tonight, then its back to drawing board. Simply gotta win these homes games against the teams in and around us.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Embarrassing some of the comments here that we've lost already.
Just need to start picking up points again enough to stay up.

Why don't some of you pi** off to support another team?
Half of you actually even been to Elland Road?

How's about the fact that we might actually NOT lose?
And even if we do, ALAW",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"I hope Cooper is on his game, I don't feel easy and don't relax when he's playing, you don't know if he turns up or not. Mot",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Notice Costa didn't even make the bench. Thought he was absolutely dreadful when he came on against WHU.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Thought struijk might have gotten a start for abit of protection at set piece play,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Much as I love Bielsa, it does seem that you can have a really poor game week after week, as Harrison has, and still be apparently indispensable. Costa not even made the bench?",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"So thankful this isn‚Äôt on sky sports tonight don‚Äôt think I could bring myself to watch and be frustrated by it.

Kilch and Bamford in the starting line up again.

Points dropped again",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Same team same formation same style of play no matter the results it‚Äôs so predictable... going to be a loooong season,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Come on boys, need 3 points today! In you we believe,",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"I have faith.

For me, Klich needs resting or at least one or two games off to realise that he‚Äôs not playing well and maybe that will give him the kick he needs. Not good enough at the minute for Leeds.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
My hubby is a Geordie - need us to smash em tonight! üëäüèº,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Struik should be in the team
Same team that lost last time out!!",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Big game Sunday may make changes for that game but tonight is an important 6 pointer come you whites #mot,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Good job he didn‚Äôt announce this in the presser to keep all these shocks and surprises up his sleeve!! üôÑ,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
I‚Äôd have played struik and Cooper as centre halves so ayling could get forward more the rest he really hasn‚Äôt much option to select my only gripe is weres the kids that r smashing up the under23s league surely there worth a bench at least mot,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"How are other players expected to get a game if players that haven't been performing are still getting picked? It makes no sense! It doesn't encourage players to pick up there game as they will just think they are doing enough to stay in the team.

I have no problems with how Bielsa wants us to play it's up to the players to put the performance in he can't help in that situation. But he does need to start being more ruthless with players.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
I bet Newcastle have spent all week trying to guess what team he would put out.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
If we dont get something tonight questions meed to be asked about playing out of form players persistently. Has to be disheartening to be a squad player for leeds knowing ur never getting in team barring injuries,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Atleast Newcastle aren't as much of an aerial threat I suppose. Good luck lads,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Only ever worked in championship cos the man was an unknown entity, so many games in to season, was bound to get found out, cos can only play 1 way . . Guna be a long old un this year!! Cooper, alioski, dallas, roberts defo struggling in this league!!",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Maggies getting beat tonight.
Leeds 2 for joy, Mags 1 for sorrow.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Harrison and Alioski down the left worry me. Big games needed for both tonight. Having said that, in Bielsa we trust.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Would have liked to have seen some changes for a bit more height at the back, just hope we've learned from our mistakes, come on Leeds",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"This 11 frustrates me, Harrison, Alioski, Klich have been complete drivel the last few games.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be saying this so early into the season but I think it‚Äôs a 6 pointer today. Got to keep the daylight between the bottom 4/5 teams and us.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
I was hoping the new xbox and ps5 would keep fifa mangers busy and off posts on here,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"I'm glad costa has been dropped, I get we ain't the best around but no excuse for how he played against westham. Please get Hernandez back in from the bench and not tyler Robert's üôÑ",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
For Harrison's sake I really hope he can perform today. He doesn't deserve to start based on his last few performances,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Got to trust Bielsa but huge improvement needed. Hope it works out, he‚Äôll get pelters if we play as bad defensively as the last game.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Wish he would change it a bit Harrison and aloski don‚Äôt work together klich is knackered can‚Äôt pass or shoot at the moment and no height again in defence put ayling rb and put struijk in defence he has the height. So watch the needles corners and free kicks given again and panick in defence,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Pascal should be playing need strength in defence but looks a good bench and I think they will be called on,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Does this mean ayling wont be doing his runs again missed it against w ham.or well I suppose bielsa gets the dosh to run the team let's hope for 3 pts ALAW,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Harrison and Cooper need to preform today they are shocking so far this season,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Let‚Äôs hope we don‚Äôt concede any corners! Set plays a huge Achilles heel, cannot score from them and can‚Äôt defend them. Problem ever since Pontus left, needs addressing in Jan as constantly costing us points. Newcastle‚Äôs only chance tonight is set plays, surely Struk is worth a go? He at least gives us some height.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Why won't he give Joe Gerhalt a go??

He's smashing up the under 23's",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Erm....is that not just the same team again??? Let‚Äôs hope Harrison and Klich wake up a bit today!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
The same team that was shocking Friday lol,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Personally would have played Struijk and kept Ayling at full back.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Not too bad hope brings on Pablo if needed,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
The definition of madness is doing the same thing and expecting a different result!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
We need some Pablo magic!!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Don't know why Bielsa keeps playing Allioski and Harrison although they were playing badly last couple of games. Am indeed very worried tonight,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Need to be 2 nil up before they bring Andy Carroll on,he‚Äôll cause mayhem to our Cooper led defence!",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Come on lads you can do it we will all be watching and with you in spirit ALAW,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3

Can we take down all the posts about last nights game please and let us grieve in peace. I'm running out of paper hankies.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Well certainly Longstaffe did not look fresh lost the ball on countless occasions and was responsible for Leeds getting at least three of their goals! Oh and did anyone notice we were ok at 2-2 then our coach decided to freshen things up then in a blink of an eye we were 5-2 behind! Awaiting our coaches response and also the fact we did not match their intensity as we know how they play ....pity our coaching staff did not realise that!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"We were very poor tonight! How Sean longstaff gets a game is a joke, he was at fault for 2 or 3 of there goals. To slow, not the correct decisions made.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Lewis can't defend runs about a lot bur no defesive qualities.

Not good enough just being able to put a good cross in!",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Stop playing Jacob Murphy be us useless!!! Let's see Joelington get a hat trick today he needs the boost. Hopefully a comfortable 3 points ‚úä,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Good line up with rotation in mind and we play again on saturday, leeds will continue to hit us so need to be solid , with this formation it limits the space they can play in to",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
I‚Äôd like to see joe on the left with Wilson in middle and Gayle on right with a midfield of Miggy and Fraser on left and right and longstaff in the middle,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
I like the look of this team to be honest. Only way to beat leeds is with width. Get around them to by line and easy taps in.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Sensible lineup considering we just played Saturday and still have 5 games to play this month when a few have just come back from layoffs. Expect Wilson to be rested for 1 or 2 of the games remaining this month as well.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Hendricks should not be playing he is horrendous worst player we‚Äôve got. I hope Lewis plays better than his last game,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Great idea Bruce, fielding Hendrick who has practically done f... All, all season, that's handing Leeds 3 points right there.

Mighty Bruce.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Think there will be more action watching the news then watching the garbage brucie has in hendrix and longstanding.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Understand the rotation, but not the formation. 5 at the back against a newly promoted team. I know there decent like but we are above them",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Dropping almiron for Hendrick is a classic Bruce tactic. Awful decision! Useless clown!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Negative formation against a team lacking confidence and results way to inspire Bruce üòäüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"There‚Äôs just been a full outbreak of COVID at the club. Settle down man you lunatics, 3 games in a week of course he‚Äôs going to rotate",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Its a good line up i have all faith that bruce knows whats he's doing and i trust his desicions,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Why is a our fanbase so clueless at times? We can't play the same 11 every week! We moan when he plays players too often and they get injured, we moan when he rotates. He has obviously opted for 3 Centre backs as Leeds are awful on set pieces so he has extra height to exploit this as it'll be our best chance of scoring.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
I understand this line up rotation and covid. Just want to see a bit of possession and attack..... Strong bench to keep the attack up last 20 mins.... Apart from Lewis I'm happy.... Hendrick has to put in a good shift,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
We Should have Started Miguel Almiron Jonjo Shelvey and Matt Ritchie but Leave Jeff Hendrick on the Substitutes Bench but the rest of Wor Team is very good 1-2 Away Win for our Mighty Toon Army Callum Wilson and Dwight Gayle off the Bench HWTL Forever And Allways UP The Mighty Mags For Life,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Not too bad a lineup keeping people fresh etc. Wish Murphy played as winger but he does a good job last time round. My only worry is Hendrick and Seany both do CDM and not go as forward but we will see how it plays out.

Keep in mind Leeds are an all out attack team so have to counter that see if they tire by half time then go offensive.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
I know I'll probably get a lot of hate for this comment but I think we will win tonight I actually have some faith unlike everyone else. Get behind the team and support them ffs,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of this lineup but I am a fan of Brucey so let‚Äôs hope he has some tricks up his sleeve.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Don't think Bruce had any other choice than to shuffle the pack but it just highlights our lack of quality in the squad as a whole, especially in the centre of midfield.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
I complained how Bruce left Lejuene career in tatters by overplaying him after long injury. I'm happy to see some rotation regardless of what I think of some of the players,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Surely shelvey must be injured how can he pick hendrick over him. Wouldnt of dropped miggy after the last game either,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Again Bruce shows he hasn't a clue.been luckier in the last few games then a gypsys lucky charm,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"3 games in a week, that's why he's shuffled the pack. The days of picking your best 11 are gone. Time for Hendricks to show us if he's good enough.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Bench looks better than most of the starting eleven! üòÇ,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
People moaning about him making changes to the team? Do they not realise how busy this Christmas period is the games come thick n fast ?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Ffs Bruce, attack Leeds, their defence is poor under pressure, everyone knows that except you it seems.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Squad rotation! People seem to forget we had half the team out with a deadly virus recently!? Another big game at the weekend, making changes is exactly the right thing to do to keep a fresh team on the pitch.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Another odd selection. Hendrick looks championship at best so far,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Looking at that line up I think Bruce is looking at the Fulham game ahead by leaving Shelvey and Miggy on the bench.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Seeing Hendrick in the team is the same feeling I had when I see Colback but I hope he perform though tonight,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"People need to remember we have 4 games in 11 days. We can't pick our strongest 11 every game. I'd rather rest a few guys today and Saturday, to allow us to play our best team for the CUP QUARTER FINAL!!",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
And this is where we lose our little run.. dropping miggy !! What a complete wet noodle you are bruce . And as for hendrick .. pffffttt,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
A very defensive line up by looks of it,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Five at the back again really?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why gayle and almiron on bench total disaster Leeds must be having a party now,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why‚Äôs Bruce got a constant bonk on over Hendrick?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Wtf does he see in Hendricks and I don't see the fascination with longstaff either and almiron was best player on pitch against wba,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Hendrick instead of Almiron wtf? Bruce needs to give his head a shake....looks like we playing with 10 men tonight,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
A five man defence? Seriously? This never works!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
So almiron who scores with in 19 seconds last game gets benched ü§î he should be starting every game no matter what,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Good to see Fraser back, but imagine replacing Shelvey with Hendrick ü§¢",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Wtf why rest shelvey and miggy they were 2 of our best players Saturday,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Might as well have stayed at hyem. Onwards and upwards this weekend though!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Looks like a 5-4-1 formation.. Fraser on the right, joe on the left and Hendricks and longstaff in the middle. Wilson up top on his own.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"If he dropped Almiron for Messi some would complain... had to make changes, at least the bench has more options (mind keep Carroll on it)",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Wtaf. People on here already saying negative comments. And you guys call yourself fans. Squad rotation may be a bad thing. But whos saying we wont win 3nil tonight with an amazing performance,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
I see we‚Äôre even more defensive than the weekend! Maybe that because Leeds are above WBA,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Good line up good enough for three points don‚Äôt know why there is so many negative fans man we win tonight go joint 7th upthetoon upthebruce,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Hope we win to shut the haters up, mind you even when we do win the haters find something to be negative about",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Need to go for it! Why is shelvey and Ritchie on the bench?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Leeds are no pushover we are doomed, doomed I tell you",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Hendrick ffs man he brings nothing to the team üôàüôàüôàüôà .,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
All those moaning about Hendrick. Shut the kcuf up now. He's scored so we are leading despite all th Leeds possession. Support ya team,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
I can't see any tricks up his sleeve I think after 18months he would have used them.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Y back 5 again? We know what type of game this is going to be already,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"No centre backs on the bench, unless Krafth can play as one. Otherwise not bad considering a lot of our star players are rumoured to have COVID. Apparently it‚Äôs not mild either, they have it bad.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
How on earth are Shelvey and Miggy benches?!?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
anybody else having a sound lag on prime?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
9 out the 11 British correct me if I am wrong not many sides can do that,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Not sure about 5 at the back asking for trouble,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why is almiron on the bench? Gotta be fatigue surely??,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Sitting to deep again, almost like we waiting to concede again",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
This manager is on crack swear down shelvey and almiron on the bench,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Gayle & Ritchie should be on... üò£üò£ but again Joelinton paired well with Wilson last week.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
What formation is that hard to tell if its 541 or 433,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why Lewis starts ahead of Ritchie?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Shelvey instead of hendrick, almiron and gayle should be starting too,??",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Poor miggy never puts in a bad performance,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
What happened to Allan saint Maximin?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Almiron scores after 19 seconds and still gets benched and gayle scores the winner gets benched ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
At last lintern off good decision gale on,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Why have we lumped it forward from about 10 goal kicks? Have lost possession every time. Brainless!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
We will get battered off leeds with that side,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
What's happened to ASM? How longs he out for?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Back to 25 percent possession not looking forward to this omg hendrick and joelinton,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
If he play defensive Leeds will punish us,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"The toon boys didn't put any comments on about the score then????.......
.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Almiron scores and then is dropped the following game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Very negative formation fear the worst,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Where can we watch the game on?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Almiron on the bench he was incredible for Paraguay üáµüáæ,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Did any of them turn up?????,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Stupid question is ASM injured?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
I hope the players know where they're playing because I haven't got a clue looking at that üëÄü§∑üò©ü§£,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Is the system 532 or 442?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Is it half 5 kick off?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Hendrick is a passenger most games, that will cost us tonight!!",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Conceded possession before the game starts,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
It was be interesting to see how this team lines up !,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
no no Gayle is a first line up joelinton not perfect sir,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Has he gone back to 5 at the back ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è either that or Hendrick at RM which is equally as bad,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Marc Gair matt ritchie on the bench aswell he runs himself to the ground and will need it against leeds,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Line up to sit back and take a battering,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Ritchie should be starting - simple,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Surely Almiron needs to be playing every match,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
"Bloody Hendrick, what a waste of a position",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Good to see Fraser back HWTL!!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3

Hendrick on instead of Almiron ffs!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Decent bench but a few of them need to be in starting 11,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3
Thought Gayle would get a game,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,-3

"An emphatic first-half Patrick Bamford penalty earned Leeds United an important three points at Elland road this afternoon helping the Whites move up to eleventh in the Premier League table against an in form Burnley side; previously unbeaten in their last four games.

Leeds managed to hang on despite a nail biting finale which saw Burnley threaten to nick something late on with chances from substitute Jay Rodriguez, who fired over from close range and then Illan Meslier keeping out a Ashley Barnes's effort at his near post.

In all honesty Bielsa's side should really have had the game done and dusted by the end of the first half with the amount of chances they created in a game they started exceptionally well, showing an enormous improvement from the way they started in last weekend's disastrous defeat away at Old Trafford.

Despite their current make shift defence, which has been forced upon them due to the amount of defensive injury's they have at the moment, Leeds looked creative and assured on the ball from the off and it took just three minutes for the home side to take the lead much to the relief of their fans at home watching.

In very unlike Bielsa fashion, Luke Ayling played a long ball over the top leaving the Burnley defence for dead, putting Bamford straight in on goal before being clattered by the on coming Nick Pope, resulting in the referee Robert Jones pointing to the spot.

Bamford confidently stepped up and smashed the ball in to the top right corner of the net leaving the Burnley keeper with no chance, one can only imagine the noise of Elland road had the fans been present .

The home side nearly extended their lead straight away with some fine attacking football from the lively Brazilian Raphinha who slid the ball through to Alioski who only had to square the ball to one of his team mates in the box but the Macedonian international failed to find any one with his cross, instead firing high and wide into an empty stand.

Leeds continued to dominate the possession in the first half with Burnley struggling to cope with their high press and energetic style.

They very nearly added a second when Raphinha pounced on some lack lustre Burnley defending, teeing the ball up nicely for Jack Harrison, who really just had to compose himself and place his shot in to one of the corners but he failed to do so, hitting his shot straight at the Burnley keeper from about six yards out.

It's those types of missed chances that will frustrate the Leeds fans because they know their side need to be a lot more clinical at this level and if that chance goes in they could have then go in at the break with a two nil cushion.

Despite their first-half dominance there were a few scares for the West Yorkshire side, I don't think many Leeds fans would disagree with me if I said they had their hearts in their mouths every time their side conceded a set piece or corner during the match.

Meslier will probably have counted himself a touch fortunate when the referee sided with him and awarded a free kick rather then let Ashley Barnes goal stand, a decision the away fans may have felt a bit aggrieved by.

England midfielder Kalvin Phillips played superbly in his new sweeper role today, dropping in deep between Ayling and Struijk, dealing with absolutely everything that came his way as did Patrick Bamford up top, proving to be a real handful for the Burnley centre backs.

Luke Ayling and Stuart Dallas continued to prove their Premier league stature and once again showed just how important their versatility is for Marcelo Bielsa's team.

In the second-half Burnley looked a totally different team and pressured the home side for the first fifteen minutes after break, surprisingly even dominating the possession as they unsuccessfully searched for a equaliser.

Bielsa made some good changes, bringing on both Pablo Hernandez and Ian Poveda, two players both very good in possession and at retaining the ball at a time when Burnley were dominating the play.

Academy graduate Jamie Shakleton also offered some fresh legs in the later stages replacing a tired looking and low in confidence Mateusz Klich.

After such an impressive start to the season the Polish international looks like he could do with a rest and would perhaps be grateful if his manager brought in another midfielder or two to provide cover for him as the season goes on.

As the game went on there was one last opportunity for Leeds to grab a second goal when their little Spanish magician Hernandez found himself in a 4 v 2 scenario on the edge of the Burnley box after a quick break from a corner but his shot just lacked the finesse it needed to find its way into the bottom right corner.

If he had converted the chance it would of eased the nerves of the fans in the nail biting dying moments of the game and put the icing on the cake on a important result for the team considering the amount of first team players out of action in what is already a very thin squad in comparison to most other teams in the league.

Marcelo Bielsa deserves a huge amount of credit for the job he is doing and for where Leeds United are currently placed in the league at this stage in the season going in to the new year.

Todays win will be crucial for Leeds going forward and I'm sure their fans will have been over moon watching Kalvin Phillips and Luke Ayling keep former striker Chris Wood in their back pockets all afternoon on a day the Australian international and former left-back Charlie Taylor returned to Elland road.",144,Leeds,Burnley,Home,1

This is going to be a challenging game but I am confident we should pull out all stops and win. Leeds are very attacking minded and with our pace on the wings we should counter attack really well. All the best. Let's get 3 pointsüòé,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
"I like the team selection today. Leeds play a high line. The team is designed to hit them on the break with the speed of the 3 young lads upfront, Fred and McTominay battling in the midfield while Bruno picks them apart. My prediction is a high scoring game like 3 - 1 or 4 - 2",324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
"Well this is a counter attacking lineup. Iam not impressed. So we expected to let leeds have the possession and try catching them on breaks.. I mean this is man united. We the second best team in the league. You don't sit back and expect to subdue leeds attack. They are a workholic team they'll keep coming till we make mistakes at the back.. All in all, all the best guys.",324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0

"Disappointed in the team, to be honest. Leeds are not the team we faced a while ago. They now change how they paly against big teams, and don't leave so much room in behind. They sit deep, and look to hit on the counter themselves, and we know how much we struggle, against the low block.",324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
"What do we have to defend against Leeds? Playing too holding midfielders? Ok I love Dan James is starting, cause this game needs is sprinting. Three points are certain, GGMU",324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
The best selection against Leeds. They're gona go low block against us as they did against City which they won. So this is solide,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
Those saying Fred out don't know Leeds United,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
"No data? The team is Henderson, Maguire Lindelof AWB Shaw Fred Mctominay Bruno Mason Marcus James.

Thank me later when I upload the goals",324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
"Reasonable to drop Pogba though, he's good no doubt but Leeds won't give him that space and time on the ball, he's gonna be easily dispossessed. Don't know about not including Cavani though. Maybe because of Thursdays matchü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.",324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0

Prediction: Henderson is going to come out of his post and Leeds is going to put one in.,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
But why not start cavani and pogba.. This is the worry I always have with Ole. He is too cautious. No killer instinct in Ole,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
Good line up. James did well in the last game against Leeds. Pogba & Cavani have serie A experience which we need for the Roma game. We are finishing 2nd in league so rest them,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
Good line up great play boys only missing was finishing 2 or 3 great chances boys came on each other way,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
Ole thinks we're going to catch them on the counters like last time round. That's a huge gamble. Hope it pays off.,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0

The combination of Bruno and Pogba were giving us some good results... I wonder why pogba didn't start but hey if that's ole's decision let's hope it brings good results,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
Almost the same team we beated them with last time. Only difference is Greenwood instead of Martial and Henderson instead of De Gea. Feel good about this lineup üëç,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0

We need a better experienced coach than this #Crook",324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0

Pogba and cavani done a lot in this team they deserve first 11 in every singel game,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0

"Good selection. Leeds play high intensity game. James, Rashford and Greenwood are all equal to that task.

"Shape up, needed to turn up. Having a week to train and practice obviously wasn't enough Bringing on subs late again trying to change game. Ole leaves it late to change subs as he hopes the team playing score and then he's justified with his selection. Need to change things up, teams know how we play.

"The game, by now, needs subs. Can we have Pogba and Cavani both?",324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
Good side to counter an energetic Leeds side . Our CB better be on their toes . Fred must speed up and not be suckered into rash tackles.,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
Don't you fear Dallas and Bamford,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0

"I really want to see Ben Davies playing. Hope he will be involved until the end of the season. I believe he has something to offer to the team. I don't know nothing about him but I trust Klopp's judgment when they bought him . Yes there are Youtube videos with him but let's be honest-there are good Youtube videos with Ballotelli, Konchesky and Jovanovic as well and we know how good they were üòâ Good luck for tonight YNWA!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
keita needs to go in the summer.When is he ever fit?he might play a game or two and then be out.Its like only working 1/3 of the time in your job and getting full pay!,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"No CL football next year.
After tonight game time to introduce younger players into team for the remaining games to see if they have it.
Planning for next season starts now",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Firmino should have played for building up ball .. Would rather like to see Shaq in middle instead Gini ..Shaq can really do some great weighed pass ..which can Jota or Salah easily turn into goal..Best of luck ..YNWA,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Williams? I do not think it is a good idea, the lad is good for his age, but not good enough right now",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Wijnaldum brings nothing to the table besides useless turns and slowing down our attacks. Can‚Äôt tackle, can‚Äôt defend, can‚Äôt play a forward pass if his life depended on it. Please move him on. Can‚Äôt stand seeing him slow down another promising attack.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Have you ever known so many get injured without actually playing?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why did we sign Davies..Poor lad. Should be given chance since we have nothing to play for,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Why Wijnaldum when he has no future at club? Also, he doesn't contribute anything apart from side and back pass. What happened to Keita, injured again? We have players who just get injured in training? Take that number 8 shirt back please.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Seriously 2 weeks without a game and then more injuries someone really needs to have a look at what's going on in training too many players are getting injured,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
10 minutes of utter boredom. Absolutely not worth watching. Liverpool players can go on holidays right now. They‚Äôve earned it this season.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
True I agree too much training in before the games. We have no clue how to chase or stop them. we are lucky to be were we are. No energy lazy tired players need a change diffidently to top up compared to top 3 clubs.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Lets go Liverpool! Best team ever and inspirational! ‚ù§üôå,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Hello Reds, and hello Mr. Klopp...
Oh today there is a big chance to come back into the race, teams around Liverpool dropping points.
Great line-up, so good luck for the guys and Mr. Klopp - sure you want to make us happy and proud - and all the best for Mr. van Dijk and for the fantastic fans of LFC.
Heja BVB...",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I don't like the defence we are having its more of gambling at a time when we are about to miss a champions league slot. At least kabak would help instead of R. Williams who many times forgets to defend n becomes a striker,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"With Chelsea having beaten Man City, our slim hopes of salvaging the season are over. Our season is a failure. No Champions League next season. No trophy of any kind. We messed our season with 6 straight home defeats. We were never going to recover from this. Our remaining games are practically meaningless.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Ben Davies will not play at all. All of these injuries when he has not played at all and he was always available for Preston NE. Club just looking for a quick profit in the transfer market this summer.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Great to see such an attacking line up at Anfield in a must win game... NOT!!!!

Three boring non assisting midfielders again, which will leave the three up front isolated, again!

.. Ox, Shaq and Bobby on the bench. I guess Klopp thinks the formation that has got us only 54 points so far is a great formation :( Has he gone mad?? 4.3.3 again *sigh.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Davies injured or just not used, whats the point of buying him? Kabak injured too?? I think someone's not doing a proper job at LFC in training. Why all our players getting frequently injured?? Williams and Philips combination doesn't sound that reliable",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Oh ffs what are we doing in training ? At this stage of the season with fk all to play for it shouldn‚Äôt be intense training. The same names injured again.. something needs to change big time. Fkn sick of this season,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Wijnaldum is overrated. He has nothing to contribute in that midfield. Firmino should replace him. Wijnaldum can come in when we are winning. Milner, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Thiago and Fabinho play the same pattern. Among them, Fabinho is the best in that role. Wijnaldum is not a creative midfielder. He's a holding midfielder that prefers to play the ball back and sideways.

#YNWA",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
A little concerned about Williams he lacks pace and ability for this level,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Phillips and Williams starting at CB? üòÇü§£ We have a solid opportunity to go out there & hand the match to Southampton as a gift. This Liverpool defense is the worst since the Rodgers era.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Not a bad line up, but would of put the OX or Shaqiri in, instead of Gini .YNWA",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2

"Too many injuries this season, the medical staff should be under evaluation!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Minor fitness concerns. What the heck are we saving them for?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I‚Äôm very Surprised with Keita been injured he‚Äôs never injured,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Need a good game from our midfield and full backs... The centre backs are relatively inexperienced and need some protection,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"That starting 11 and bench,we look like an average team.need to get players back from injury and buy some quality in.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I honestly think they want to lose R Williams in the back and Gini still gets game even that he is leaving. No proper depth in this team.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Would av started Bobby instead of Jota, Jota looks better when he comes from the bench. Most of the game he starts end badly. Shaq should av started instead of Gini.
Would gone for a 4-2-3-1 formation.
Chosen back four, 2; Thiago & fabinho, 3; salah , mane, Shaq then firmino on top. My suggestion though. Put in klopp we trust. #ynwa_liverpool_",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"I know Klopp said Nabys future is at Liverpool, but come on. We have to sell this guy, he's been Klopps biggest flop at the club. 50+million for what?",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why are we still starting Gini ? He‚Äôs leaving let‚Äôs start planing for life after him! Ox shax kieta Jones should all get a chance,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I would rather my 60 year old dad with zero football skills played centre back than have Williams,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
We bought Ben Davies because ?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Good to have Fabinho in midfield, helping out both the defence & controlling the midfield!

Attack wins u games but defence wins u titles!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Rhys Williams can't defend to save his life. He is slow and always out of position,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Keita again on the treatment table.......at this stage I think its getting ridiculous.....
.he is an injury prone liability and should be one of the first to be sold or released this summer",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
3 seasons with fitness concerns for KeitaüòÇ,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Y do we keep playin winaldum an makin him captain is a kick in the teeth safer playin players who want to b ther,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Williams is concerning... But, glad to see Fab staying in midfield and not at CB... Obviously need the 3points today!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Wijnaldum is a big joke
Can‚Äôt wait for the next season",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Woodburn:D just seeing his named included is great,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I think keita is now turning into a liability .better we sell him,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Nothing less than three points tonight. The reds have to win every game now to stand a chance of top four. Chelsea's result didn't help but we have to go for it.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Another different CB pairing which again makes us vulnerable but glad to see Fabinho back in midfield as he makes a massive difference in how we play when he‚Äôs there.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I don't understand how Ben Davies hasn't had a game I've heard he's decent just want him to play a few games to have a look can't even make bench,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams start for Liverpool.

Ozan Kabak, James Milner, Naby Keita and Ben Davies are ruled out due to minor injury concerns.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Let the B team played rest of the season. No way absolutely no chance for top 4. So Let the B team take it from there. Sad üò¢ next year we‚Äôll be playing Thursdays instead of Tuesday and Wednesday.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why do we keep using gini? He is leaving by the end of the season so why would he play his heart out by risking injury?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Still a strong line up especially with fab back in midfield,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Kabak? This is season we just so unlucky and klopp selection sometimes cost us,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Oh no. Oh no another slow midfield and jeepers wijnaldum again !!! Hes useless and too slow. He can't tackle and never puts a thru ball . Never gets injured cos he can't tackle and gets rid of the ball sideways or backwards- what klopp sees in him I'll never know and he wants to go so why keep playing him - give ox, keita or shaq a chance, but klopp loves gini too much. Totally baffled !!!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I think this is the 23 different partnership defenders....,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why the F##K is gini playing. Naby should be starting. Sorry klopp got it wrong again. YNWA,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"We need to buy players
Our subs doesn't just cut it

A big game tho
Let's fight for the 3 points",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Keita has a minor fitness concern? How did that happen?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"If Klopp never gives playing time..to subs when he needs them they do not perform.
Firmino should be playing today
YNWA",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
If we are not 3-0 by halftime then it's going to be a long slog for us. If it's 0-0 at 70 minutes then we could lose 1-0 or draw 0-0. We struggle against the teams in the relegation zone.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"We've got two unexpected gifts, from foxes & spurs. They should be used in full measure. Head On,Reds & YNWA!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
The time for Gerrard seems to be close. Klopp's bad signings continues to worsen the team.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Tiago not suited 4 epl we should let him go play ox or.they must.get someone who can cause a goalscoring threat,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Chelsea win against city could even be a blessing in disguise, leichester still have to play united, Chelsea and Spurs, fourth place still for grabs",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
No Davies again. Poor lad. Feel he‚Äôs been harshly treated. Deserves a chance.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why is Wijnaldum still playing? Why not rest some players here and there to see if you have any quality for next season because this season showed just how much we lack in depth?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Whoever the fitness coach is at Liverpool needs to be fired.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Come on lads... Chelsea just beat City, now make our day!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Another week another injury, are they training for wrestling match or football match.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Good line up. Good to see midfielders in midfield and defenders defending. Firmino on the bench is a good move too. üëç 3 - 0 to the reds.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
That's what happens when we play defenders in defensive roles,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Wat happened to kabak coz Rys has no pace,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Apart from the Chelsea game, results have gone our way! Boys prove to us that you‚Äôve been working on your finishing, and get the win!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Salah and Man√© are only interested in who is on top of goals player stats. They are not playing for the team. I think klopp should study Bayern M√ºnchen.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Ke√Øta injured again? What happened this time?

Just asking.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Of course keita is out with a fitness concern...... the guy is a walking, talking fitness concern",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2

Davies must be injured ?? Surely worth spot on bench ahead of Billy or even a start ahead of Williams,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Another loss just give up on this season and next will be the same unless klopp goes,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Where the heck is Ben Davies the lad who's being sign to fill the CB position... Why waste money when he's not going play,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why do we keep starting gini when all he‚Äôs talked about is leaving try bobby midfield,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Gini starting again??? Just cant understand why playing a midfielder who slows down the attack if the goal is to go for 3 points,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Good luck lads...but why is shakiri still on the bench atleast, yep we really need to rebuild...even on the bench jones is the most like one to do something",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
All this names are no longer a threat to anybody anymore . Change of names are needed next season.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I wonder how players do not play and get injured. What about keita. Always injured and klopp says he has a future at the club,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Bench is very poor how have they all got injured we not played in over 13 days ü§¨,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2

"For those who have been complaining about klopp's team selection, what do you have to say now?",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why did we buy Davies? Was it Klopp's choice? Don't think so.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Does Ben Davies actually exist? Is he even a person let alone a footballer?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Playing with fire again , still haven‚Äôt learn learn lessons of letting in late goals while defending 1 goal",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Very well done to Liverpool. Let's end the season on a winning note and enjoy playing with each other. DON'T worry about Chelsea or any other team. We just do what we can. We atleast deserve to play champions league next season no matter what place we finish. It's a been a tough situation for all with covid messing everything up. But we keep going. #YNWA #LFC #TRUSTINKLOPP,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why we playing Rhys is kanaka is injured and where Gini today,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
5 games 5 wins needed anything else no UCL,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Defence is oh so shaky. Midfield sluggish, but the wingers are playing well. Better finish needed, again.
Come on lads.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Should have started Woodburn in wijnaldum's place he don't deserve a place in the LFC side since he is leaving at the end of the season,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Finally Klopps puts Jota in Firmino's position, no offense Bobby is awesome but I know Jota will score today",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"I take it Ben Davis was a bluff/
decoy purchase to silence most fans who were concerned about our defensive fragilities???? ü§î",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Gini is picked again? As Captain? Absurd. That guy has no impact going forward or bring in any creativity to the team. Can't see this lineup beating Southampton.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Where is Kabak? Why didn't Klopp play natural centrebacks against Leeds and Newcastle when he could? Can anyone tell me what is wrong with this club?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2

The team is looking so weak lately first choice and bench doesnt look strong we need a proper number 9 a wini replacement and a adrian replacement asap and konate and another cb,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Not a bad line up let's see if we can get payback fir earlier in the seasonü§û,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
We need to overhaul this team... Keita and origi should be thrown away,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Davies out with minor fitness concerns.

I thought he would drop wilson as we will need him fit for the leicester game i dont think he will start against liverpool I think the team is set up to try and keep the score down. as goal difference will come into it at the end of the season. I will take a 2-0 defeat keep the score.

Hayden called for a hard foul from behind and shown a yellow and the game hasn‚Äôt even started.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
This is just a defensive side hoping for a draw also why‚Äôs jonjo not even on the bench,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
Bruce got Pep in managers secret Santa and wasn‚Äôt very original giving him 3 points,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
He's aiming to keep it under 5 and keep his job...,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
I can't wait to watch us counter attack with Joelinton slogging it through the middle.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
Surly we could of put a stronger team than that out!?,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
You can guarantee joelinton will be in I don‚Äôt know what he does to get his place Mike Ashley must insist that he plays,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
"I genuinely believe that City‚Äôs 9 man bench would defeat our starting XI. Aug√ºero, Zinchenko, Steffen, Laporte, Mendy, Fernandinho, Mahrez, Foden and Palmer are a league better than everyone starting for us today except Yedlin and sometimes Almir√≥n.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2

For gods sake somebody sack Bruce! Wilson on the bench! Is he having a laugh!,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
"So the tactics are to park the bus before kick off, dig in for a long and boring match. Then maybe sub Wilson and Gayle on for cheeky goal at 80 minutes... and to use Bruce's favourite quote, ""with a bit of luck maybe knick a win""...",147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Our prolific No.9 rather then Gayle leading the line against Man City , greatüôÑ",147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2

At least Lewis and Sean Longstaff are dropped,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
Weaker team than cup game is this guy for real!!!!!! Jesus!!!!!!,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
Might be a record premiership score tonight.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
Why does Joelinton start every game. Useless always.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
Anyone know what the Premier League record is for the team with the lowest possession in a game? I think NUFC could beat that tonight!,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
"I can imagine Bruce's teamtalk.
'Now Matty I know it's City not United. But if you just think of the Manchester in the name you might get the goal.'",147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2

Oof.... 5-4-1? We already expect to lose... Wish we'd wild out like Leeds... Score 3 give up 4... Better than just sitting back losing 2-0... Or more,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Plan A sit back and soak up all the pressure. Plan B, sit back and soak up the pressure. 90 minutes Joelinton walks off the pitch completely clean having never touched the ball!!! ü•±",147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2

"I originally said 7-0 to Citeh. After seeing this line up, I'm gonna say 11-0.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
So the obvious message is we are playing 11 men behind the ball...this is embarrassing and we haven't kicked off yet....,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2
"WTF, is that line up all about?? It will be like the alamo all over again, and we all know how that ended.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,-2

"Okey.. We have a okey lineup, but with Bruce to tell them how to play we are f*****. We have no plan. Doesnt want to play football. No movement.

I don‚Äôt understand how Joelinton and Hendrick get a start ahead of Almiron. One of the more creative players we have. They better win this one. I‚Äôd take 1:0 right this second.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

Ready for the toon too dominate possession... play free flowing attacking football and just completely dominate through the middle of the field... toon by 3+... it‚Äôs the last day of 2020 anything could happen.... but if we even get a point or manage to lose by less than 3 I‚Äôll take that as a win,157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Home,0

Under circumstances a reasonable line up but BRUCE the all shitey needs to let them have a go. I'd have had Gayle in instead of the awful Joelinton.

Mane was busy pissing around. Indecision was his problem.

Salah ate all our chances like carrots.

"Hendrick and Shelvey? Two of the biggest passengers this season. Poor.

Nothing against, Darlow, but I would be curious to see how Dubravka fairs in goal... Darlow could be doing well with amazing saves, but would Dubravka be better at providing much needed instruction and direction to the defense?",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"3 at the back again, we're short of centre backs and this is his solution. The only reason this PE teacher still has a job is because he is a yes man and Ashley loves when his employees do as they're told. Sure Sunday league teams wouldnt touch him with a barge pole at this point.",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Very poor in last game so let‚Äôs just put out the same team apart from Fraser and Murphy how Shelvey still gets a game is beyond me and Hendricks isn‚Äôt even a championship player by what I have seen,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
A pretty pathetic line up clearly playing for a draw a point is no longer good enough at this stage we need a win we need three points! Burnley have overtaken us and Brighton are hot on our tail and they play Fulham should be playing 4-2-3-1 our best formation.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendricks on starting eleven. Is this real life? He must be very good at training since in games he is always bad. Dont know what brucey is watching.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Probably deploy hayden in defense and invite pressure from a good attacking side rather than going for the jugular there defence which has proved leaky time and time again.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"5 at the back, at home, against a newly promoted side. It pains me to say it but I‚Äôm pleased I haven‚Äôt got BT, and I certainly won‚Äôt be going out my way to find a live stream for it. Ridiculous.",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Wtf did he not watch the last game !!!! Leeds will rip us apart again,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

"That's the worst team HE BRUCE could have picked.. what the f..k is HENDRICK in the team for he does absolutely nothing.. Carroll should be on instead of Lewis.. I was going to say I am shocked by this team selection But it's gone beyond a joke . He hasn't a clue. ‚öΩÔ∏èüç∫‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏èüç∫

You know. It‚Äôs fast getting to the stage when I look and think. It doesn‚Äôt matter which 11 he starts with. I have zero confidence in it. Disillusioned much,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Lewis again. Must be Bruce's love child. Can't pass or tackle, Shelves, needs to play and pass quicker. A heavy Leeds Win i think",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"I‚Äôve been a lot less critical of Bruce than most but he‚Äôs starting to scramble about... why ‚Äúdo it my way‚Äù and then give up on that two games later... Darlow has sold the first goals in the previous two games, great stand in for Dubravka but your number 1s fit again, bring him back in... Lewis is young and still got loads to learn, giving the ball away too much, take him out and let him watch the game evolve... massive steps backwards with this selection and we can‚Äôt go back very much more",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Ritchie over Lewis. Lewis‚Äôs confidence is absolutely rock bottom. Not exactly blessed in the middle of the park either with Hayden covering CB. üôà,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Again pack the defence hope we can fluke one on the break then defend the rest of the game. Leeds will be camped in our half shooting at every opportunity. Another defeat coming up question is by how many?,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
If that's the team I cant believe Lewis and Hendrick are in the team.thats like playing with 9 men.manquillo is on the bench and we have a winger at right back.even if he plays Murphy I would rather have Ritchie at left back instead of lewis.lewis is terrible. Surely Carroll instead,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Lessons learned from Villa, then",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Looks like 541 again. Should have back 4 Manquelo Schar Lascelles Lewis 4 Almiron Shelvey Hayden Richie 2 Wilson Gayle - I take it Max isn't fit enough for a full game yet,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

Hendrick?? Surely that's a typo. Lets go back to when we weren't doing it Bruce's way!,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Wrong in so many ways the team on the bench would beat the team picked,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"What has Gayle got to do to get a start, and don't get me started on how Hendrick's gets anywhere near the first team squad nevermind starting. Bruce has absolutely no clue what he's doing. ü§¨ü§¨",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
If St Maximin is fit play him if not 100% fit why on the bench? If we are loosing by time he comes on he won't change the game. Another poor selection come on Bruce just leave,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"How Hendrick starts over Matty is beyond me
Also against the most defensively weak team in terms of set pieces, and with a short defence, would be been smarter to play Ritchie/ Joelinton/ Carroll

"I can name 5 - 6 that I think are championship players there. Prove me wrong lads, come on... no lazy play, 100% effort is needed!",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

Future prediction but also very predicable, no one coming in and Bruce still here in a month üò¢",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Front 3 is okay but it‚Äôs the midfield that lets us down. No creativity , no ball winner. A draw would be a good result against an attacking Leeds side.
It can‚Äôt get any worse can it............",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Would have been better off putting 2 traffic cones in midfield rather than those 2.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendrick and shelvey the worst midfield partnership we‚Äôve ever had shelvey can‚Äôt run and Hendrick contributes nothing to the team.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
With this type of line up he‚Äôs asking for the fans to hate him ... he‚Äôs begging the club to sack him... he want out but he want the money to go with it,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

5 at the back? Think I‚Äôll offer my services to go paint the tyne bridge with my toothbrush.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendrick again man!! And shelvey is Playing terribly at the moment!! Start ASM. Take him off when he‚Äôs done. Get bloody Matty or Ritchie on. This is getting beyond a joke. Think I‚Äôll go and paint another wall! It‚Äôll be more exciting,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Cannot believe Shelvey and Hendricks are starting!!!!,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Gloves must be back on then,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
At least Jonjo will be nice and fresh after his casual walk around Villa Park on Saturday night.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

"We are at home , not playing an away game. This is not a team to go out and win the game . We have 2 midfielders that will get overun in Shelvey and Hendrick. Lewis needs extra cover like Richie in front ,or better still leave him out as he is not strong enough on his own.
We should be playing 2 up front . Like Wilson ,Carroll . Or Wilson, Gayle.
This is going to be another embarrassing 3 points for Leeds with this set up.
How many more games have we the fans have to suffer before he Sacks Bruce. üò°ü§¨",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
How do Shelvey and his partner in slothness Hendrick keep getting picked ahead of Matt Longstaff????? Seriously man cabbage,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

you keep saying it‚Äôs a work in progress but we keep seeing the same approach in every match and every match it ends the same way, us losing.....love

Has he put the gloves back on 5 at back,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Every game that goes by .... the more danger we are facing. We are the worst team in the league by a wide margin. Something has to change,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
More or less same team. Fraser and Murphy more likely to get forward if allowed to. Fear it‚Äôll not happen,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
I actually predicted 3 -1 before the start. Sorry family i think we are heading for relegation if nothing is done immediately. Good thing Steve Bruce is not a manager in South Africa because after 2 games he would of been fired. But after 11 games without a win still keeps his job,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

Hendrick always put in a shift for us regardless of the position he was asked to fill. What have you lot been doing to have this impact on a decent player ?,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

I'd pick 11 defender and hope the Leeds walk off in disgust. Maybe just maybe we will snatch the win. Other than that we are fubarred,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Why the hell he makes two right back (manqiillo and krafth) sit on bench and makes hayden take their place fail to understand. Hendrick or shelvey together are a problem instead one should have sat out and hayden should have been in their place.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

Hendrick and Shelvey in midfield again says it all!! Why give Matty a new contract and leave him on the bench every game üòñ,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

Not a bad line up today üëç Wilson and Willock come on 2nd half for Joelinton and Longstaff. Try and only play them for a little while to save them for the harder games to come.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
We‚Äôll have to be on our Lingard today!,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Not an easy fixture this... but we hope! Good luck lads!!!,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"How does Longstaff get a game above Willock, if we even have a sniff of signing him I'd go for it. But knowing us we'll let him go back and someone else will have him",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Is Brucey on some sort of promise, since he plays Joelinton every week?! Should be Wilson starting, we need our best players.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
I don't fancy our chances today would love to know how longstaff gets a game and we will sit back as norm with jokelinton up top u can see none of our team have confidence in him as it was last week as soon as he went off we play attacking football and won,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Wilson, Gayle, Carroll... carol the tea lady.. all better choices than Joe. How many golden opportunities will he miss this game I wonder",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Probably will be unpopular opinion but joe can do a job by making mistakes that ASM can get on to. Not a great tactic but I think it might work. Agree willock should be in there though.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"3-1 to the Toon today. Easy 3 points. Showed some passion against Spurs and an average performance despite the win against Burnley. Love how negative some of our ""fans"" are üòÇüòÇ HWTL",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Joelinton is he a forward or not? They continue to say he's not but play him as the main forward (4 goals in over 70 games), use one of the other if he's not a forward, I get that Wilson not fully fit/risk, Joelinton though ü§î",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Well let's see what happens now, but bloody turn up to play today TOON COME ON ‚ö´‚ö™‚ö´‚ö™‚ö´‚ö™üëçüèª",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
How can he be playing Joelinton. It's a Joke . Gayle or Carroll would be better if he wants to keep Wilson until 2nd half. ü§îüò°,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Don‚Äôt think ASM will play the full game and Wilson may come on late 2nd half... rather see them 2 play together to cause problems,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Should have started his best team, big mistake as west ham are buzzing at the moment, agree that willock should be starting, and willson but even gayle ahead of joelinton, think they have too much for us at the minute 2v0 down after 40 minutes I can see, if we get anything from this I will be massively surprised, but come on the Toon!!",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
How dose joelinton start every game is beyond me,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Come on Joelinton take ur chance to score a goal...He will score today as he did last time at ST James,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Would we be happy with a point today ü§îü§î. I went for a wee this morning and really do feel up for this one COME ON THE LADS,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Till I seen that starting 11 we had a chance. Not now with the jokerlinton in there. Is he shafting Bruce or what,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Darlow injured??? Not on bench?,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Would of dropped Joelinton instead of Gayle like 95% of the fans ü§îü§î,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Willock never getting a start, he'll be away.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Beware of Bowen he will be out to prove a point for NOT signing him when offered to uus from Hull, he has come on tons in his first season, direct, fast, and dangerous, Richie and Dummet need to be at their best",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Looking at the comments on here you have to ask yourself if some of these people actually watch the games or just like slagging players off for fun. Clueless. üòõ,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Willock should be starting, as well. Him, Miggy, Saint-Maxi & Wilson, our best 4 attackers and half of them are on the bench. üòè",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"good old Joe,,,still keeps his place----------
---what for ???",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Wilson and Willock to make an impact off the bench (to replace ASM and Miggy maybe). See this as a big score game with leaky defences. But 3-2 to the Toon at FT. Just my 2 pennies.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
What‚Äôs willock done wrong to be put on the bench again? He‚Äôs a stand out performer for us.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Prefer Willock above Longstaff and I really do hope Wilson is able to play 30 minutes at least for Jokelinton,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Wilock for Longstaff, and Wilson for Our Joe at half time.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Willock for Longstaff and if fit, Wilson over Joelinton, and that's an alright team ... worried about our defence here though, I want Murphy running the wing forward not having to cover at the back",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Joe linton wouldnt start or even get in any other team in the premiership as a striker,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Why does he keep persisting with joelinton?,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Not Longstaff again ! he can't kick a ball straight and is slow as a carthorse, get Willock on instead..",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Can only assume that Wilson not 100% yet.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Would love to have Gayle play alongside ASM, but he may score a load of goals and Bruce doesn‚Äôt like that.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Would have had Carroll up top for the 1st hour then bring Wilson on not Joefuckinlinton
again FFS .. and willock instead of longstaff",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Cannot believe we have people saying Wilson should start. These are the same fans who would be slating Bruce for starting him if he pulls up after 60 mins with a recurring muscle injury.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Interesting comments regarding who should be playing centre forward. Not a mention of West Ham's former centre forward Andy Carrol who would be busting a gut to play against his old team.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Right team choice. Hope we grab some belief as west ham are shaky at the back. I can see us winning this one today but we need to watch out for their counter attack as they break so fast from the back.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
It would be Andy instead of Joelinton wouldn't even have him on the bench,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Carroll on the bench yet again, hes going to end up leaving us! Just play him ffs! He's a better option than most of that team!! ü§¨",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Disappointed our Brazilian variant starting, beaten before we start üò°",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
not having Lascells leaves a huge gap in our defenders. Clark and Dummet looked scratchy at points last week,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
He said in interview last night about wilson and maxi didn't know whether to start incase of injury to either,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Where's darlow on bench???,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Murphy should be in Joelintons position Shelvey should be in the stand,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"If wilson is fit enough to be on the bench then I‚Äôd start him, bruce has said that he came through training all week ‚Äúunscathed‚Äù start him as he is the most likely one to score üôÑü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
A good team apart from the undropable donkey that is goallintin,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Wilson should start and bring maxi on, he's way better as a sub imo...",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Would start willock over shelvey or longstaff any day,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Get rid of dummett ! ü§¨,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"Just get at them from kick off ,need more effort like last week ,up the toon.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
No pace in the centre of the park lingard is gonna walk through,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"What is the obsession with Shelvey, he's gash!",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Joelinton to produce the goals I mean WHY else wouldn't he??,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Is Willock injured?? he would be first choice for me,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
What about Willock starting instead of Joelinton?,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
"No complaints with that line up. Keeping Wilson and Willock for a late salvo, is a good move.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Gayle would be better.... Grrr I hope Linton sparks today.... Not sue of Longstaff and Shevely.... Would prefer Willock and Shevely,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Looking forward to another joelinton hat trick.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1

I like it! Looks solid. Hope Johnson plays well. Looking forward to some revenge over the Geordies. COYI ‚öí‚öí‚öí,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Great to see Oggy back and hopefully both Coufal and Johnson push on ‚öíÔ∏è‚öíÔ∏è‚öíÔ∏è I think St Maximin is class so hopefully he plays left wing and not right wing, as we could have problems if he does ü§î",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Getting punished today where other weeks we have got away with it. As per usual making it hard for ourselves with sloppy play and mistake after mistake. Ogbonna back and now Dawson off and suspended, you just can't make it up.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"No benrahma as usual, i would like to say that it's unfair but it's not, Benrahma has to do more to deserve a place in the team",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"No surprises there!
Really like this team, yes we lose with Creswells crossing but with no Antonio and Sousek not getting as far forward being partnered with Noble it‚Äôs no big loss.
Ogbonna is going to be much stronger in defence then Creswell.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Strong team and great to see Ogbonna back. Huge game today and a win would really put us in a strong position going into the Chelsea game coming up. Plus Spurs and Everton dropped points last night! COYI!! We can do this ‚öí‚öí‚öí,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Benrahma has to ask to leave a club whose artistic value is unknown if he wants to save his football career from being lost üò°,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Much better bench than we‚Äôve had in a while!,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
For some reason I am more worried about todays game than any recently. I watched the 2nd half of Newcastle game last week and they looked good so hope we are not complacent ‚öí‚öí‚öí,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Safe to say it has not gone to plan. A bit of a back-handed compliment but that's our worst 45 mins for some time. Letting AFC get back in that game was poor but they're a much better side than NUFC.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
At least of ogbonna is back for some defensive solidity glad to see yarma and lanzini back in the squad COYI ‚öí‚öí,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Well the attack looks good, but Johnson in the team worries me a lot. Gets caught out our turns over the ball too much. Noble is too slow to cover his sloppiness",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Happy with this line up and no doubt they have worked on it in training to know each others responsibilitie
s and avoid confusion",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Always gonna be difficult with our current injuries - but still no excuse for us not to turn over Newcastle with that line up! COYI ‚öí‚öí‚öí,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Seriously questioning the point in signing benrahma games like would be great for him yet moyes consistently leaves him on the bench and gives him a five minute cameo occasionally. And before people jump on it I‚Äôm not criticising what moyes has achieved with us this season it‚Äôs been outstanding I just don‚Äôt see why he signed him if he won‚Äôt play him in games like this where given the chance he‚Äôd tear Newcastle apart,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
At least we have a few half decent options on the bench now,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Ooooo..... a bit nervous about this one..... sitting on the settee with my Geordie husband ..... who‚Äôs obviously not supporting the Hammers!,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"worried about Saint-Maximin dominating Johnson, glad Oggy is there for support",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Lanzini, benrahma on the bench but johnson starting.. I get moyes likes players that run but jeez has he not learned from lingard that the quality often shows in technicians.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Who is Dawson.2 own which cost us dearly.Now red carded,and looks like because of him another 3 points have been given away.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Concerned for our defence, you can't play Diop out on the right and Ogbonna on the left, no rice either, we gonna concede alot",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Honestly think benrahma should be in the line up... he never gets enough play time! Why sign someone when they arnt being used almost ever.... 5 mins here and there in the odd game isn't enough,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Disappointed that we‚Äôve lost masuaku and cresswell but more than happy with Ben Johnson as a LWB think he‚Äôs good enough to do a job, Oggy bring back is a massive plus for us.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
I dont get it. How can it be a break for a t**t to change shoes... Send him off and get on with it ffs...,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Good team. Don‚Äôt really want to change it much yet. Fornals And Bowen deserve a run in the side. Benrahma hasn‚Äôt done anything in my opinion to break that. Johnson is the only viable option at Left Back,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Bruce didn't favour Bowen in the early days at Hull so I feel like he might have a point to prove today. He's been a great signing for you!,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Difficult to criticise the manager with our position in the league. Johnson doesn‚Äôt give us any attacking threat though, so personally I would have preferred a back 4 and Benrahma in at the expense of Diop.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Love how so many people on here still think they know more than a manager that‚Äôs got West Ham to fourth with a handful of games to go üòÇ,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Too defensive we need to go all out attack,we are so much better than them. I fear getting caught with a sucker punch.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"A BAD day at the office today.
Too many schoolboy errors.
Proof also today that neither Johnson nor Benrahma are physically ready for the Prem yet.
Both are just not strong enough to cope with it.
Johnson had a torrid time of it and was 100% at fault by being too weak for the challenge for the winner.
But we go again next week!
COYI ‚öí",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Masuaku injured again I wonder? Benrahma is a threat but he‚Äôs giving the ball away too cheaply, must work harder to start.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Westham are digging their own holes and dissapearing on them...too much mistakes.
Let's hope for a come back",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
The line up is a little bit on the defensive side today - come on Moyes ‚öí,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Maybe play Benrahma during the portion of the game when our defenders aren‚Äôt panicking out from the vackc,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"St maxim got his wrists strapped for fantastic dives, careful in the area boys ! COYI",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Is Benrahma a wing back? No
Is Benrahma a holding midfielder? No
Is he currently better than Lingard or Bowen ? No

Bench it is until HE PROVES otherwise!",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Only problem playing Johnson is that he isn‚Äôt very proficient going forward, the width will only come from the right hand side, so will be lop sided.
I‚Äôm not a Fornals fan so perhaps would have put Lanzini or BenRahma there instead. Whatever, we need to take the game to Newcastle.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Nice to see Ogbonna back. Let's see how our back 3 does. Looks really strong. COYI ‚öí,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Solid, and a good bench to up the tempo if needed.. Like to have seen fredricks pace today",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Poor old Benrahma can‚Äôt get in the side when we are 3 players short,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"What's up with Masuaku, now!?

Johnson could be a great RWB, but on the left he can't cross on his weak foot. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Let's get her done, attack hard the whole game. No second half come backs please ü§û",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Team needs a bit more attacking from the likes of benrahma or masuaku,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Would of liked to see benramha start but moyes ain't done to bad so come on you irons,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Good result for us last night, 3 points today and we're 3rd. Starting to actually think this is do-able",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"This match is made for Benrahma..he would destroy the Newcastle defence..hopefu
lly he gets his chance?‚öΩÔ∏è‚öí",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Come you Irons, big game today.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Would like to see a Lanzini and Lingard double act before the end of the season, would be interesting COYI",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Cue the angry Algerians ‚öí,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
203 angry Algerians! Lol,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Would have rather seen Benrahma on the left as no pace in this line up down the left,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Good line up today. Nice to have some attacking options on the bench. COYI ‚öí‚öí‚öí,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Very similar to team against Man Utd far to defensive no need for 9 defensive players against a team like Newcastle very disappointed,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Sorry Moyes... too negative today. We slipped up against Brighton doing something similar.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Come on COY,today only 3 points...from MILANO",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"I think noble will player further forward, diop will pick up Rice role, if they both stay deep we‚Äôre screwed üòÇ perhaps Moyes just doesn‚Äôt want to go 3-0 up early lol",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Good line up, come on lads 3rd place is calling ‚öí‚öí‚öí",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Oggys back to steady the ship at the back ‚öí‚öí‚öí,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Masuaku injured again?,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Reverse psychology - Moyes is going to let them get 3-0 and then if we come back for a change.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
This is a good solid team but I would like to see Allan Saint-Maximin to join West Ham in the Summer,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Another Master class from the Lord himself.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1

"Johnson is rank, put him on loan somewhere to get experience.... cause he's not at a standard to be in starting 11 or the bench to be honest.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Back 5, hopefully not a negative one.",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Old West Ham are back this is a terrible first half with 2 stupid goals to have conceded,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
What is wrong with all this Algerian with angry react,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
We need get noble off.. he is taking too much time on the ball and killing the tempo.. we dont play like that anymore..,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1

We've rode our luck in too many games lately.. something like this was always going to happen..,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
Not happy with the lineup,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Away,-1
"Thought maybe a couple of the youngsters could‚Äôve at least been put on the bench. They may have got a short run out if we were sat comfortably. Then again... we are VERY rarely comfortable

Other than that, looks a good team",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"Just goes to show how far away the younger players must be if not one of them are included in the squad to play in what is effectively a dead rubber.
Or is it just a short sighted view of getting an extra million or 2 for finishing a couple of places higher?
Either way it wreaks of ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt have a long term strategy apart from staying up‚Äô",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
Great team but would rather Gayle over joelinton or put them together,367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"For all the talk of the youngsters and are so called decent academy, shame 3:4 don‚Äôt get the bench with a potential chance to shine and Jeff Hendricks does??? Awful",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
Surely Anderson should be getting some time in the squad at least. No better time for him to get game time than against bottom of the league when we're already safe.,367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"Short sighted not to have a couple of young guys on the bench, at least. We are safe and therefore have nothing to lose so if we could throw a young player or two on with 20 minutes to go in a winnable game it would have been beneficial to them",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"Love how you some of us are still slagging Joelinton off - he‚Äôs got 3 in his last 5 starts. Yes, his overall record is poor. I‚Äôm not saying his recent form deserves any praise in the grand scheme of things but honestly some of the bashing on here is ridiculous üôÑü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
Does anyone feel sorry for Manquillo. Thought he was coming on well last year but now doesn‚Äôt get a game,367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1

"honestly, it took me sometime to believe when I read the first half statistics. something like 12 shoots, 66% procession, 200+ passes. Maybe 8 to 10 matches ago, all I asked was a proper football match from Newcastle. Not survival, not dominant performance but simply a proper football game with defence and attack, passing and dribbling, anything with basic football skills and teamworks. It was really bad, and it makes the recent display unbelievable. I knew, by watching these two teams over two seasons, things can go from bad to worst out of the blue. But lets hope for the better with the spirits inside these bunch of players.",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1

"Said it all season, time to change formation, before it‚Äôs too late",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1

Where to start? .... just put a proper shift in and look like a CWAK Blades side we recognise.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Wilder's obsession with playing McBurnie will be his downfall. He's spent ¬£20m on McBurnie and that's not working so give the other ¬£20m striker Brewster a run.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1

The main point is that this is a Team Sport and we need the whole team playing together.

Will haller move today or as usual just stand looking uninterested ! What a complete waste of 40 million quid ! Reckon we wouldn‚Äôt even get 10 for him now !,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
This is where we need consistency against the smaller teams‚öí‚öí,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Ohhh the zuzzy Benrahma comments as per. The lad will get a chance when we hit a sticky patch, which we inevitably will. You don‚Äôt change winning teams, particularly at clubs like ours where we quite often can‚Äôt string 3 passes together let alone wins. He will get his chance and when he does he‚Äôll need to prove himself. Just because he has 8 caps for Algeria and scored a few goals for mighty Brentford in the Championship doesn‚Äôt make him Dmitri Payet. Patience...",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"For the first time, the effects of my anger outweigh the effects of my admiration, thanks to the Algerians üòÇ",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Settled team, settles familiar formation gets the best out of players",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Good enough line up apart from haller playing the guy just does not seem to be interested and is not fitting in well . As Algeria says throw their Superman in to the deep end and see how good he is.come on üá©üáø let‚Äôs hear you ‚öí.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Looks like just me that would play Bowen through the middle, drop Haller and play Benni ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, or move to a back 4 and play both. The back 3 has worked so far, when we had less ball, but this is what annoys me about Moyes, inflexibility. I guess he doesn't even use subs, so we have no chance of a new shape. For me against a defensive team, we don't have enough creativity. Let's face it, we just scraped past Fulham and we'll do the same again today....hopefu
lly.",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Haller again. Has he got something on Moyes, because he can't be picking him for any other reason. Once again starting with 10 men",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Haller getting stick again.
We don‚Äôt play to his strengths. He was unbelievable at Frankfurt playing as a front 2. We put him up top by himself and expect wonders. It‚Äôs silly.
To get the best out of him, we need to sacrifice the 3rd centre back and put Bowen/Antonio (when fit) up top with him....... won‚Äôt happen though and he will be made a scapegoat.",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Get ready for the noodle writing and angry faces,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Where is it ?üëáüòí,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Haller is lacking confidence and he isnt suited to this type of play. But I am seeing improvements, hopefully he can turn this around.",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Surely we must have someone better than Haller in the youth teams, or perhaps in the ladies squad. We might scrape a draw with him in the team if we are lucky.",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Need to start blocking these Algerians that support the player not the team. ‚öí‚öí need a big performance today COYI ‚öí‚öí,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Big mistake playing Haller could actually cost us the game it's like starting with 10 men.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Where is great footsoccer all time best Benrahma player of all time great best,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Souƒçek is much better than Benrahma so we will win :) !!,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Good line up today.. we sort our crosses out haller will get a couple of goals today. Think I‚Äôm in the minority that thought he was actually okay against Fulham but we didn‚Äôt give him the best service.
Hopefully Bowen can have a good game today as he hasn‚Äôt been his best the last few games. COYI ü§û",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Moyes would pick the same team even if we played Barcelona one week and Southend the next ....he should be picking a team according to the different opposition....h
e is now picking favourites....",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Come on good win hopefully and get us up that table . After being robbed at Arsenal and Liverpool .,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
This is really going to upset the Algerians,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Anyone asking why Benrahma on the bench, should maybe remember his last contribution for the TEAM in giving away a penalty... that we were lucky to get away with. Impact sub if needed, then fair enough.",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Haller has got to be exceptional and really shine today. How many chances is he going to get or how many does he need? If he doesn‚Äôt perform, or at least look interested today, it must be his last match!!!",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Algerian fans....it's all about the team.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Haller had better play well and smash these lot or Moyes is going to get some deserved stick! Would be typical West Ham to loose to bottom of the league after such a good run against the top teams. Playing totally innnefective players ain't gonna help!,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1

I know it took Antonio a while to break into the team but I don't understand why as a club so often we chase a players signature for ages and then don't play them for months. Hopefully Benrahma gets his chance soon otherwise what was the point in signing him,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
where are go be Rahma,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Benrahma is world's best bench warmer. He win game by using the force. Next he play for Jedi FC. You will see this.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
Big game today. So important we win. Especially after all the hard work against the top teams. But with Haller starting again today .. still feel like we are playing with 10 men. He really needs a big performance today. COYI ‚öí‚öí‚öí,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"I am hoping we will win today. I am not interested in individual performances. Just a want a joint team effort and hopefully a clean sheet. Irons, Irons, Irons üëäüèΩ",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
So he's didnt rest balbuena and no antonio on the bench,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Ffs!!! Haller over Benrahma what's the point in signing these wonderkids if they dont play

Ohh I know we are 2-0 down ... let's bring him on 88th min",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"We got 3 points out of this and somehow the dominant position of this is angry reacts. At some point we all have to come together and just stick behind this crew, screw GSB but if we can get behind them then maybe we can turn things around. I know it is nine games into the campaign, but we are doing well for ourselves. We are the driving force behind this club, but we can be as close as the ones to sink it as well",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"It's Hallers last chance saloon for me,if he doesn't put a shift in today i would stick him in the stiffs.",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
I'm wondering why Ben Rahma and Lanzini are on the Bench ....try to give a chance for all players to show what do they have and not we call the bench by their names than we asking why they won't give the addition in the group once they play,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
See I'd try fornals upfront instead of haller and benrama on the left,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"3 4 3.. wasn‚Äôt our cup of Tea. Used this just to support Haller. Bowen to much for himself today Haller didn‚Äôt really work himself into a position. But a surprise ball ü§îwhacked into ü•Ö. Giving Us 3 pts.. No subs till late in the game..
Moyes is really forgetting to look at the clock ‚è∞...‚öíüëè",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Moyes and his team going for the soft option and easy cop out with Haller . Hardly unexpected from a staid manager . His credentials matter with his subs and when .
For me I think he has it wrong again and he will get it wrong later .
This me will tell",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
"Sorry but haller contributes nothing in this formation, he doesn't even hold the ball up and bring the midfield into play.",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
ŸÑŸÜÿß ÿπŸàÿØÿ© ü•≤,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
All the best today you hammers. Mind you they will only blame tevez again if they go down. From all at Sheffield Wednesday,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
I believe you should stick with the same team if they are playing well. Only change it if the manager feels he has to,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1
When we will see our boy Benrahma in starting line-up.... he got skills to show... the bench is for him,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Away,1

Do it for yorkshire sorry bean there done that need to be a bit more Sharpe.......,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Home,-1

"Big chance for you lot to get your first win tonight. We are severely weakened with no Richarlison, James Rodriguez, Digne, Allan. Plus Coleman & Gomes on the bench.

"Bin playing baht midfield since we lost Coutts an Duffs , gone backwards !",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Home,-1

Apart from dcl we have no one too score the goals God help us if he ever gets injured,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
Two full backs that can defend not that we should need it against the opposition! Now that we are solid at the back gives us the confidence to go at Sheffield who should capitulate if we get an early goal!,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
It is always up to the coach to develope the Academy players and play them to their strength just like other team doesüòÅ,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"I love this club, have done since 1984. Scrapping a 0-1 against bottom of the league is what seasons are about, reminds me of the 80‚Äôs. COYB",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"After Wednesday & with a number of players missing , my pessimism has returned",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
Seems a shame to do Chris Wilders legs if we hopefully get the 3points. He dislikes Klopp as much as the Gladwys St....üòÅ,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"These games we have to win, no excuses tonight

2 pints these gave ffs",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
2 keepers on the bench? Curious. A little worried to not see Richarlison. That energy is hopefully not missed too much.,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"No one has lost to Sheff Utd this season in the league...Everto
n - ‚Äòhold my beer‚Äô!!! Be happy with a draw given that lineup!!",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
Davies needs to pick his socks up and start performing. Glad to see Gordon have a run out at last. I fear the worst but hope I am proved wrong. COYB,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"Sheffield United not won all season...Please
step forward Everton football club.",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
Said it last game swap Gomes for Davies will give us a bit more bite in the middle glad to see Gordon is getting a go strongest team possible with the players we got.COYBüíôüíôüíô,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"Great to see Gordon back and Branthwaite on the bench again - was very impressed with both of them last time they played. A chance to go second as well, and upset the red lot. COYB",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
I can see my brand new telly getting kicked in after the first 20 ! üò≥üò≥üò≥,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1

"Great chance of bringing a youngster like Simms into the match day squad, but no, we have 2 substitute goalkeepers ????",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
Oh dear ! Here we go ! Davies starting is enough for me !! Looks like we going to try for a point against the mighty Sheffield Utd !!! üôàüôàüôàprove me wrong Everton,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
Buzzing for Gordon. The most exciting young player we have. COYB! Feel we need to get a few goals early on n kill the game. The lads looked shattered at 60 mins the past two games.,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
If we want top 4 we should be beating these teams.No easy games but this should be 3 points even with our injuries.,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
The way our luck goes against a player not scoring for 5 years goes on to score a Hat trick against us. Give Sheffield the 3 points nowüòÇ,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
Hope James is enjoying his Christmas... beginning to wonder if all the hype about him was worth it. Best of luck to the players who actually wear the shirt week in week out. COYB!!!,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
We have an opportunity to go second...but can we get a first win without Richarlison and prevent the Blades getting their first win of the season? COYB,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"Nice to see that we are all in favour of Gordon getting an opportunity. Pleased for the lad.
Then you notice 2 keepers on the bench, a youth player could of had an opportunity.",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
Why not give Simms a place on the bench instead of 2 keepers!? Seems mad that ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"Wudda preferred to see holgate in the middle along side decoure an coleman at rb, can pass a ball good in tackle an wud at a bit of pace to the midfield",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
Siggy to score tonight..... mark my words üòÅüòÅ,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"The Micky mouse cup does it again! Hopefully we can win without Richie but it‚Äôs gonna be tough. Glad Gordon gets a shot though, we really need him and iwobi to play well tonight.",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
We know how this one will go. Chance to go second against a team that hasn‚Äôt won this season and bottom of the league ü§î. More worried for this game then I was in the last 3 PL games. COYB!!,148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"Digne, Richarlison, James and Allan missing. Huge huge losses. There‚Äôs not much creativity in that side sadly",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Away,1
"Having two keepers on the bench just shows how little depth we have surely?

Still hopeful/
confident

"C'mon Blades, let's upset the odds today and just maybe make other teams a bit jittery üî¥‚ö™‚öî",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"Baldock deserves to keep his place, and Bogle gives us much more attacking wise than Osborn. Osborn will definitely be on at some point. Probably a bit tactical, too, to make sure we have at least one midfielder on the bench.",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"Love those lads in our back 5 but 3 are out of position.
We‚Äôve played 433 most this seasons second half‚Äôs when losing. Can‚Äôt see why we don‚Äôt start that way and have 4 defenders playing their actual positions.
Hope I‚Äôm missing something",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
So we see a 4-4-2(1) formation with real battle get us 3 points midweek and revert straight back to the formation that‚Äôs lost so many games this season. I hope I‚Äôm wrong - COYRAWW üî¥‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
The only thing I have to look forward to now is seeing how much and where Lundstrum ends up - I‚Äôd say he shot himself in the foot but he‚Äôd miss,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Burke needs to be on at some point or we will never crack the defence.,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2

Give Brewster a full 90 mins to show what he can do let‚Äôs hope our midfield give him something to chase ‚öîÔ∏è,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"This is a Brazilian strategy, it is a rivals' strategy against them and it will be like he fights against himself, let's see how he is.

This is a plan for Mr. Ralph Hasenhuttl's team, it is a defensive game where you will position 7 people by adding them to 8 and 9 in the defensive area and making the game use the location and map you want. It will be played in the manager's track, taking the position of 7 and 8, and then playing in the 4 and 5 and 3 man plans.To make the game in front of the goal frame, use the playing area of the players playing in the area. All come in and shoot the door.

This plan is to bring that sword back. I made a book for England to see, how fun it would be.",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"Go for broke.. nothing to lose and have a 4-3-3 attack

"Omg!! The same shape that hasn‚Äôt worked all season - no creativity- we will go behind and change it with 20 to go, maybe 442 or 433 and look better - why not start with a different set up? What is gong through Wilders head this year?",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2

"Norwood, Bryan, Burke, Lowe not in the squad? Anyone have an idea why?",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Good line up, shame there‚Äôs no Burke I think he should be starting but we shall see, in wilder we trust ‚ù§Ô∏è",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"From an outsider looking in, Wilder is still playing lads that got promoted from League 1, he has spent alit of money and leaving these on the bench for ageing league 1 standard players, maybe he needs to trust his new signings rather than trust the old guard who aren‚Äôt performing",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Quite a few of the ""1st choice"" players are just not good enough for us now -they have served us tremendously well but its time for them to move a side :
Fleck
Norwood
Sharp
Jags
Basham
McGoldrick",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"A lot of these comments where pre game. I‚Äôd not watched it and was on catch up, went to look at the line up and thought immediately what is this! Sorry that line up looked awful! We need mobility and we play jags!? Bryan had done nothing wrong? Stephen‚Äôs is Mike‚Äôs away from his best and Lowe was growing in to the role. Last week was arguably our best performance to date this season and we make 4 changes. My first question being asked for wilder thinking, I‚Äôm far from the wilder out camp but this is now very worrying",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Poor front line up. We have better talent on the bench. Why pay 30 million for a player and never use him properly.,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"We‚Äôre not getting the luck we had last season when too many PL teams were playing poorly, so we over achieved but the party is now over! Maybe the PL could pay us our parachute payment early so we could buy some players so we could try again in 2022?ü§™",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
No pace again and no creative midfielder- could be a tough game for us again.,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Wrong team wrong set up and behind to complete incompetence of Rammers .... for a last line of defence his decision making is absolutely dire,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Can make as many changes as he likes, he can‚Äôt control the constant garbage goals they keep giving away

Ramsdale isn‚Äôt up to it and you can see the boys at the back don‚Äôt have confidence in him",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Burke and Mcburnie isn‚Äôt working, that‚Äôs the problem with this team and the sooner the manager changes his tactics the better.",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"A much better line up, we deffo needed a change. But why isn't Brewster with Billy up front??? All that cash we paid for him and he's always seems to be on the bench!?! Well let's hope this pays off for us! UTB!!! ‚ù§",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Why did we spend 20 million on somebody who can't or isn't right for the team...if we are going down I can't see the sense in not giving the lad game time to increase his confidence..it just seems a total waste of money otherwise ..üôÑ,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Brewster and mousse start before billy for me love the kid but he‚Äôs not good enough and I think this is his last game before leaves in jan that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs started,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"come on lads, let‚Äôs get that first win!",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"I get bringing jags & billy back because they will drive the team , being blades supporters. Don‚Äôt get Burke missing from squad been most consistent player for me",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Concern over Jags lack of pace with Adams and Ings. The big question is can we keep a clean sheet? Ramsdale makes some good saves but always looks like letting one in.,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"It‚Äôs about time Brewster had a start, he‚Äôs never going to get settled if he‚Äôs not playing",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Panic line up jags will get ripped to shreds by Adam‚Äôs nothing wrong with the back three last week yet again we mess the defence around,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Something going on with Brewster??? Seams very odd we pay ¬£24m for him to sit on the bench all the time,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Like it. That left side of defence is a lot better and I like Ampadu in midfield. But I still feel that‚Äôs Berges position. He‚Äôs got absolutely zero pace and we lack that in midfield. Either play Berge in front of the back 3 or play Lunny. UTB ‚öîÔ∏è,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Lots of sentimental claptrap about Fleck, Sharp and Jagielka. Championship players. Sunday League thinking.",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
I wish you good luck. you will have your first winning of season today.,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Billy's presence should hopefully galvanise the lads.
Hope Brewster gets more minutes aswell.",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
As a Swansea fan Brewster was class when he was with us scoring goals for us and it‚Äôs a shame he‚Äôs not with us now we really need him our team to play upfront and it‚Äôs a shame u not playing him and he‚Äôs always on the bench send him back to Swansea ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Time for Fleck to step up and produce a big performance,sto
p hiding and repay the loyalty being shown.",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Get that ball in the box and Sharp will find it. Billy Sharp scores goals, especially against his former clubs",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
I‚Äôd love to know what dirt mcburnie has on wilder!!,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Cant be worse than 11 put out in the last 11 games,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"I know he's getting on but sharp still knows how to score, got a good feeling about today UTB",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Norwood not even on bench.... like a different player from last year,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Ampadu in his best position would love to see Burke and Brewster up top.
As yet again team lacking any pace.
Hopefully they will prove me wrong.
UTB",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Osborne for fleck and why is burke not in the team or bench hes bin one our best player when he bin on the pitch,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Think it's about time jags was put in as cover this season for joc. Isnt that why we got him in first place for experience and being a blade. shudda whacked him on before see how he gets on might be slow but is defo solid at the back for others to push forward.,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Horrific. Two has-beens, a midfield passenger and a goalkeeper who doesn‚Äôt. There are some deluded people around today...",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Nowt to lose giving Billy a go, probably overdue.",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
It's great that US fans still debate the best 11 to put out and We still cant agree lol UTB!!,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Coming from a Wednesday fan Billy Sharp is your best hope Where's he been,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Billy and Brewster should be paired upfront in my opinion ‚öî,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
What an odd looking side,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"And a strong bench, wonder if Wilder wishes he could make 5 substitutions ü§£ü§£ü§£",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
"Looks good , ,no Burke on bench ??",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Well weve got to try something but back looks a bit slow on paper but lets hope this works,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Great to see the Captain back on the pitch. COYRAWW üî¥‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3

"Back to championship style starting line up almost, I like it, get back to basics and grind the performance out! Captain and leader back on the field could make all the difference.",119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
So long as Burnley and Fulham lose today we wont lose ground üôÇ,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Good line up jags is what we need at the back surprised it‚Äôs took this long to get him in won‚Äôt help us going forward but we need defenders to defend at the minute and billy against his old club great call nailed on he will score.,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Osborn for Fleck for me,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Great to see Sharp in the starting line up,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3
Midfield is the problem 3 quality players required but blades wont pay the wages.,119,Southampton,Sheffield Utd,Away,-3

"How the hell is Redmond in team ... I‚Äôm starting to lose patience with this , he has been shocking ..... Adams and Ings have been building great partnership",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
A good team apart from you know who Adams more likely to get you a goal.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Would off left out redmond and would off played forster,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Your punching well below your weight !!! Play Che Adams . He can assist and his vision to pass forward is amazing and pass perfect if strikers are in the box üëå,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"The Redmond bashers are probably the same boo boys that wanted Forster out of the club last time his form dipped....

In Ralph we trust üòá",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I think Ward Prowse should teach Redmond how to kick the ball in the air.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I get salisu not starting being he has been injured with muscle problems for a while although I would like him to start lol but I would have given forster a shot,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Redmond? Needs to be confident in his ability rather than struggle on with poor form. Could be a world beater if he believed in himself. Surely the sports physiology experts can help!? We know he can do it. Very inconsistent,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Decent team... And more importantly a decent bench with options,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Great to see a strong team going out, saints have been playing well and not just the finishing has let them down but also bad luck with VAR and good goalkeepers. It will come together, keep believing",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I think Redmond must really be something special in training for Ralph to keep the faith with him. ?????,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Well what a load of critics we have here today, just get behind the team. Not long ago everybody was agreeing with Ralph.",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Foster and McCarthy are both quality keepers we‚Äôre lucky to have the choice!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Mccarthy a very lucky boy, redmond needs to turn up ball control shocking",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Strong team üëçüèª good to have the squad more or less back in one piece! Onwards and upwards!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Adams needs to come on strong as sub today. Redmond not my first choice but he may surprise us today.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
How the hell has the same team that played the other day not playing including Clean sheet Forster I trust,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Lots of experts on here with no experience. In Ralph we trust üëäüèª,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Beautiful block on defender by Redmond to allow Ings an easy shot at goal for the goal,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
¬£5 on Redmond to score a hat trick. ....,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Forster for McCarthy . Redmond ok but needs to bring his game today. Romeu ok but stop giving fouls away on edge of box n stop getting booked , otherwise go get 'em boys üëç",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Hopefully Redmond can run into more cul de sacs,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Forster back on the bench is a bit of a surprise,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Looks strong to me, and for once, some options from the bench COYR!!",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Not bad, but would have preferred Tella to Redmond and given Forster a chance ‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Redmond needs to learn how to beat the first man when crossing the ball....and forster should be given another shot Mccarthy has been shocking for a while now,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I wish he would bloody drop Redmond and McCarthy,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1

Would have started Forster ahead of McCarthy but other than that about as strong as we have at the moment. Would like to see more of Tella today as thought he was excellent on Thursday,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1

Redmond up front? Seriously? Do we not want to score ? Such a waste of space,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1

Must not lose today after the surrender on Thursday. Concerned about the lack of pace in this back 3. Traore has the ability to change the game but has long lost his form of early last season. Southampton already have the psychological advantage going into this one.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"today has to be a win! at the very least a good display with a draw. kilman should be starting, saiss and donk play better up the pitch, but with otto back, he was bound to push saiss back, good midfield, samedo is better in midfield than defense, neto is always king and hope adama has a one of his good days, let's hope he knows when to release the ball and gets it to his man. please Jose, get a couple, get your confidence going! the quality in this team is there, just need nuno to find it again, he is a quality manager and I know he can make these players work!",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Hopefully a bit of tinkering from Nuno, we need support for William Jose to be more effective. Two up top with one behind rather than 1 with 2 wide men. Get Semedo and Jonny further up as well to give the width lost by using the 2 up top. Other formations haven't worked.",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Strong side, I'm surprised Kilman doesn't start, but I like Saiss' energy and drive. The other positive thing I've found from this post is the people of Myanmar appear to be much better now. Good stuff all round, just in time for Valentine's! Come on me babbies! üê∫üß°üê∫üß°",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Excellent. Let‚Äôs hand a defeat back to Southampton!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Unbelievable! Coady the only defender on the pitch. And he was a midfielder!!! Kilman has more than earned his place... Gutted for him.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Feel a little sorry for kilman BUT most experienced team available all of whom are ""men"" who have played at this level consistently no kids so have to hope it's good enough. Feel traore is due one of his on fire games and Jose to score if we can actually give him a chance",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
I am not seeing any coordination so far. Hopefully we improve in the second half. No individual brilliance. No team work,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Neto and adama need to be tucked in closer to Jose and Jonny and semedo need to have the space out wide, else you end up with 2 on each wing and 1 in the middle to aim for, been our biggest issue this season! No movement off the ball and too many players not knowing where to be",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Wld do well to get draw an the reason just can't detect where our goals will come from our midfield must give our front three better service ‚öΩ‚öΩ‚öΩ,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Hope Jose turns up today, his first two games he looked really good, his 2nd two games, as sub, looked lost?
Needs the supply to him",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Semedo for however...rubbi
sh.
Kilman dropped....rubb
ish
Dendonker is a midfielder.....
rubbish
Otasowie should be playing.
Rubbish selections...Nu
no out, out, out",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Our best 11 at the moment with the injuries we have , come on wolves üê∫",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
I would of preferred max and saiss but they both play left side of coady shame really as I think that would be more solid. Donk is a great player but drifts as he's more of a midfielder,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Gotta get ball forward more and get shots on target atleast work their keeper. Good luck today wolves. Please no sitting back all first half.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Can't believe he's left Kilman out he's our been our best defender for a few weeks. Can only see a Southampton win,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Looks like a sideways backwards midfield battle again then when are we going to get a midfielder who just for once advances past a striker,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Why no Kilman ? Dendonka is a midfielder, Semado is rubbish....Nuno
has lost the plot...sack sack sack....another
defeat coming",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
That‚Äôs a well better lineup! To watch the game against Southampton today there is a free trial for Amazon video at the top of my website! I‚Äôve put the link in my bio! Just hope we put in a better performance than in the cup üôÑ COYW!üê∫,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Good to have Saiss back. Kilman playing so well in that position though. Always tough to chose between the two. Let's get a good result please. NO OVERTHINKING COYWS üß°üñ§,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Here we go again üòÅ the Wolverhampton rollercoaster continues - come on me babies!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Looks like strong lines up now lads we need to get bk to winning ways let's get revenge from in the week and kick start our season bk up coyw,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"With out doubt the worst team in the league. At least those below us are trying to play. We offer nothing none of them look up for it doesn't matter what team we put out. Garbage.!!!!!!!
!",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
I'm sorry but there's no defending this performance we look as though we can't be bothered playing a team who have conceded goals for fun and can't register a shot on target. Absolutely dreadful,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Strongest team we can put out, considering the injuries, well done Nunoüëç",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
One wonders Whom Traore models his game on either losing bal on his backside n no defending the commentators mentioned his 200th game in English footie boy has he learnt anything,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
No excuses with his lineup. Stick with it for the rest of the season. Injury permitting,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
We need the win today and a good performance been a difficult season so far but still have faith in the boys and Nuno the only player I don‚Äôt rate is semedo I just don‚Äôt get it at all he offers nothing in my eyes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Sorry but Dendocker is not a defender, should be up there helping out in attack. Lose this one and it‚Äôs squeaky bum time ü§£. Just need the three on the bottom to keep losing.",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
1 down already this team is so out of sink it's un true an William Jose come on get on the end of the ball or get off an get silva on at least he trying,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Gutted yet again, usual 1st half/2nd Half",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
This is the type of game that can be the desired turn over. Winning will get us 2 positions ahead. Come on Wolves!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"That‚Äôs better....shame
he put a crap side out for the cup,
Need to win today to prove it was the right decision üí™üê∫",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
I'd say that's our strongest 11 with the exception of Jimenez. This afternoon will tell us alot about whether we've progressed,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
S'ton have lost the last 5 league games in a row. Its obvious what will happen today.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Kilman in instead of Moutinho, and I‚Äôd have agreed with team. Pushed donck into midfield",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Why dedonker and not kilman, they'll run us ragged down that side. Oh well another loss, relegation here we come",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Better play better against them today than last time cmon Wolves üê∫,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Please Nuno just no negative tactics......ra
ther lose 9-0 having ago than all the backwards sidewards crap.strong team....FWAW",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Why not killman. Way better defender than saiss or donk. Love both of them but they are midfielders and killman hasn't put a foot wrong all season,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Does this clown never learn? 5 at the back aagin against an out of form teamüò¥üò¥üò¥,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Would rather have Kilman and move Donk to play with Neves and drop Moutinho. Just hope we start on the front foot!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
What has Max done wrong? Been the best defender on the left this year?,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
How as he left hoover and kilman out? Would have liked to have seen Owen O in for mout,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs dropped kilman though.I thought he was a stand out player of the last couple of pert,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"This is the team that should of played in the FA cup, COYW 2-0 today",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Come on lads. Shut the doubters up üê∫,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Would prefer kilman. But stronger over the rest of the field,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
All i ask for is a shot on goal,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
looks like kilman carrie the can for thursday just hope we show some attacking intent today for me ottosoowie neds some game time,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
As strong as we could possibly be. Hope Willian Jose has a decent game. It‚Äôll be crucial.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Poor the other night but get behind the lads and management big 3 points would be nice,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Don't understand what Kilman has to do to keep his place. If Nuno wants to play Saiss can't he play Max left side Saiss in middle and Coady right like he did when he was forced into it early in season?,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
With this line up it seems another Southampton win,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"If MGW gets on in front of any 1 on bench, then i,m done",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Must be me but didn't realise dendonka was a defender..,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Prefer to see Kilman instead of Dendoncker the lad has done absolutely nothing wrong , but in Nuno we trust üôè",238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Come on wolves 3 points needed,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
That‚Äôs more like it. Think this is the best Nuno has available at the moment üß°üñ§üß°üñ§,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
I feel so weird. Why others think saiss is not deserved in starting line up? He's one of the best CB in premier league. Oh God what a joke english fans. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
Why drop kilman,238,Southampton,Wolves,Away,1
"Southampton are red Chelsea are blue, I'm watching wolves today,

Looks like we ARENT bothered about having a positive goal difference this year by the looks of things. So much for being watertight at the back over the last 11 game. Every set piece will remind me of 2 years ago with comedy defending,368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
An interesting starting line-up. As long as we‚Äôre attacking all the time we‚Äôll be fine. We know MB doesn‚Äôt mind an early change if things aren‚Äôt working out.,368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
Casilla No No No. More flapping for crosses and corners. I hope Cooper and Llorente can cover his errors.,368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
"All the armchair managers out there !!! Have we learnt nowt the 3 years Bielsa been in charge ??....let him pick the team how he see's fit.53 points, comfortably mid table in the first season back and playing entertaining football.In Bielsa we trust ü§çüíõüíô",368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
"Pascal has been the biggest surprise of the season, I hope this a temporary change as he‚Äôs a much better centre back than Cooper and will only improve with games
The keeper swap is obviously temporary as the icemans place is secured",368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
How on earth can he start in goal and gutted for Pascal he‚Äôs been outstanding.,368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
If we‚Äôre making swaps and changes and weakening the side I‚Äôd have given the whole of the main lads a rest this game ready for game where we‚Äôre back in. Caprille should have been getting nod but Kiko did give us half a season in goal in promotion season in which we had best defensive record. Not my choice at all but it gets him in shop window. Cooper fair enough he‚Äôs captain. Rodrigo deserves a pop up top after last week. Hope we do it but these changes have weakened the team.,368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
"I like the idea of giving different lads a run out but why not a few of our under 23s who have done so well
Hope hernandez plays at home for the last game",368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
"Bad start and that‚Äôs nothing to do with the keeper, 2 games left resting players, in a far better position than expected, anyone would think he‚Äôs changed side when where fighting relegation.",368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
Welcome back to the chaos at the back...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ! Good luck to them both.. am sure I needn‚Äôt bother mentioning either name..ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è! But seriously I hope they do the business for us..ü§ûüëÄü§û,368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
"Eat your words, in Bielsa we trust, and great Berardi had a run out..mot",368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
"Great to see everyone getting behind the team, and backing the manager's team selection. Marvellous , expected no less on here",368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
MB letting Kiko play before he lets him go imo... and Coops has led us to the promised land MB showing them both some respect imo as they won‚Äôt be here next season...,368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2
"Can't say that Meslier doesn't deserve a rest. The front line looks great. Which Alioski will turn up today I wonder, and what face will he be pulling?",368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2

"I really wish people would lay off Cooper.

He‚Äôs the captain of our team, picked by the players, he loves the club and loves the city.

The first captain to lead our team to the Premier League in 16 years!

The guy might make mistakes as all defenders do and often get punished for it but all those slating him at any chance need to look at what he‚Äôs done for our club on and off the pitch before being so disrespectful.

Might not be starting 11 next season but I still want our captain at our club.",368,Southampton,Leeds,Away,2

Player to solidify that position, is a waste of resource? What I found curious is Moyes decision to put Yarmo on when taking Ant√≥nio off? Even when Bowen came off, Yarmo was not showing anywhere near the same energy levels that Bowen was, even when he was so late in the game and had run himself into the ground.

Proud of Moyes for not being bullied into rushing Benrahma and sticking with the players who've performed recently, he didn't rush Bowen and we all know that was the right thing for the TEAM and the PLAYER, Fergusson never rushed a player either,

I would've felt more comfortable with Diop's pace rather than Balbuena who had a bad first half against Spurs but we'll see and that's a strong bench aswell,

Also would feel more comfortable with Johnson on the bench than Fredericks who I do like but Johnson can play both wings and is more into defending, if Cress or Mas gets injured than we're back to one of them on the left in a back 4 üò¨ unless in that case Ogbonna plays left but Cress in a back 2, anyway i'm overthinking it ü§£

"Hmm. Wrong team selection here. Haller should be playing this. I would take Fornels amd bowen off now and put Antonio on the left haller up top and benrahmi/
lanzini on the right.

The ref is obviously a villa fan.

Anyone else getting frustrated with Bowen? Been absolutely terrible the last 5 games.
If we make changes soon this game is definitely ours for the taking!! COYI",100,West Ham,Aston Villa,Home,1

Harsh on Kilman,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Very attacking and no Boly. 3-3,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Podence and neto
Played with good heart, semado what a crap at the back. Marcal
As well",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Got better last 20 minutes we can win this , silva is doing ok",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
If we are playing a back 4 then I would play boly instead of saiss but personally I would go back to the back 3 ...with Kilman possibly instead of saiss ....but I like saiss ....I wouldn‚Äôt be a manager!!!,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
A new formation after 3yrs??????,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Hope Fabio plays well should get some chances hope he can finish them. Despite his age 35 million puts the pressure on.,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Wonder about Saiss for Boly- why Not MK? This attack should blow Villa out of the park. 4:0!,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Let‚Äôs give Nuno and the lads our full support

If silva ever want to become a hero ... today‚Äôs his day,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Great see Saiss back as we‚Äôve been lost without him, I think dropping Neves might not help,he always bolsters the defence when we‚Äôre under attack.fingers crossed Silva comes into the game early on and maybe just maybe he grabs a goal to boost his own confidence, this transitional period we‚Äôre in don‚Äôt look great at the moment and it will take time to get used to it but I‚Äôm sure when it does work we will go on a winning spree FWAW1877",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Win today would be great but it could be a draw local derby?,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
How tf are you going to score without a striker?,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Risky line up, prefer 3 at the back. Also the bench showing how desperate we are for a striker or two!",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
I personally would have played boly instead of saiss,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
I wouldn't be surprised if it is 3 at the back with Neto as a wing back. Hope I'm wrong but can't for the life of me see us going in with no recognised centre back in a back 4.,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
I see the Siass move he can always slip into midfield and help out when required. Very attacking ...I like it,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
I luv the passion Saiss shows but his commitment to tackles but can be overly reckless at times.,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Love it brave attacking line up n fully agree on the change at the back, would be great to see Fabio score today he defo needs it good luck boys COYW üß°üê∫üñ§",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Worried about Saiss lack of pace üòï think Kilman is unlucky not to play,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Happy to see Saiss back..,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Nuno has had an amazing impact at this club. He is however due a bad run. This could well be it, or atleast the start of it. I hope i am wrong. 2-0 villa.",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Got a bad feeling about this game we haven‚Äôt got anyone who can hold the ball up since we lost Raul I hope I‚Äôm wrong but we need another striker ASAP one that can hold the ball up,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Looks a great attacking lineup. Boly has been poor this season so far and Saiss always gives his all. Hoping for a good win COYW,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Happy to finally see a 4 2 3 1 tactical sheet !!!!
The 3 4 3 we used to play is not bad but all teams in PL were used to play against us the same way...",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
I would be pissed if i were killman what has he ever done wrong to warant saiss playing in front of him far as im concerned killman is a much better defender than saiss hes never let us down,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Just thinking how Neves is feeling. Being left on bench more than ever.,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Saiss addition is interesting, could be a 10/10 or a 2/10. Shows that no one is unstoppable though, COYW üê∫",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Saiss and Coady in a back 4 doesn't fill me with confidence, Coady is so much better suited to playing in a 3/5. I hope I'm wrong because I like them both",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Really hope Silva gets his goal today, if we get into the game early he will certainly have a lot of support up top with those 3 around him!",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"I hate being negative, but I really think a back 3 would have been better for this game. Have the donk sitting on Grealish, start Silva and have two out of three Neto,traore and podence starting. Villa are prime for getting counter attacked, yet looks like we are going to try and dominate possession, doesn't fell like best tactic. Hope I eat my words.",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Don‚Äôt like 4 at the back not enough from either full back going forward n Semedo against Grealish ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
You guys should score 2 goals for me today,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"When Boly came back from his long injury, he was simply incredible. Don't get me wrong, I am thrilled Saiss is back. I am just saying when Boly will be back in the starting line up, it will be an amazing moment. Hope he gets some good rest. I thought we would have a back 3 today but excited for the match. COYW üß°üñ§",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Very tough match utw,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Can feel a big result brewing for the wolves, 4-0",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
with ONE at the back and BLOODY LOADS in attack!!!!!!!! üò¨ü§£ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Hopefully playing Silva gives adama neto and podence space to cause damage surprised boly been dropped think kilman will feel bit aggrieved saiss ahead of him,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
What if the reason Nuno benched Boly is because Saiss is better than him when they play with 2 CB,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
No Big Willy today!! The magic happens outside the bubble and I think thats where Nuno has gone today. Something about this lineup looks very promising. Come on me babies.,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Brave selection here. Nuno probably feels Saiss‚Äôs positioning in a back four is better than Boly‚Äôs. His passing is definitely a lot more decisive. He must‚Äôve seen something in training to give Silva a chance. Good luck lads,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Finally, Fabio gets a start, let's see what he's got! F W A w",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Coady costs us 2 goals last week bolly gets dropped another defeat on the way i fear,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Good line up. Delighted to see Saiss back in the starting 11,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"BT sport pundits inc Glen Hoddle thinking we are playing 442, absolute geniuses, supposed to know what they are talking about ü§îüòÇ",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Surprised Saiss ahead of Kilman. Distinct lack of height and pace at the back.
Very happy with the front 4 though.
C'mon Wolves!!!",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
"Think dropping boly is a big mistake, yes he's not been playing well lately but none of the defence as tbh.
Rather the 3 at the back tbf",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1

Is Trez injured?,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Away,1
"Anybody saying no Trez? / would have played him? He‚Äôs not even on the bench, so I guess he‚Äôs not fit enough to play right?...to many opportunities this season, no end product...just saying! UTV!!!",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Away,1

No back up striker! Looking forward to seeing Ramsey develop and hope Traore can push on.,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Away,1
Decent starting 11 but a very defensive bench. Worrying if we pick up another injury or need some flare late on.,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Away,1
"Good to see Ramsey in there give us some much needed speed and energy in midfield, the lack of depth is worrying, bench is poor, no striker shows how much we need one in January UTV...!!!",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Away,1
Why is Barry not a sub at least,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Away,1
"With Bert Traore not being able to play a full 90, I'm worried about not having Trezeguet on the bench. Been missing sitters recently but is still better than El Ghazi, who hasn't played 90 for months",120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Away,1
Looks strong. I would've given Trez a shot at putting it right. We just need to be at it from the start and get rid of silly schoolboy errors. UTV,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Away,1

Strongest lineup I think we currently have but would have played Kilman for Donk but with Max and Saiss both being left sided can see why Nuno has not gone for this. Hopefully Neto and Traore play closer to Jose again against a Leeds team that does concede goals.,250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1
"like it, still think kilman need to start. let's hope we get more in the box when the crossed get in!",250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1
"At least he‚Äôs kept the selection consistent, hopefully we turn up 1st half!",250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1
Let's hope the second half team turns up from the start!,250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1
That's a good line up....Hard from the start Wolves....need to get above them and start chasing down teams...coyw WW,250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1

"It's a good lineup, it looks promising. We've had good effectiveness with Neto and we're causing more danger with Jose than with Fabio.

Yup. Dendonker needs to play better but great to see the same side out again.,250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1
Good lineup - the question is whether they all come out of the dressing room in the first half and play some decent football ‚öΩÔ∏è Leeds will go at us in the first 45 assuming that we might be wobbly until we do our usual trick and turn it on in the 2nd half.,250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1

"Great lineup, COYW üí™üèºüî∂üê∫",250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1
Be interesting to see the formation. Dallas LB?,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Over the past few years I have always been on the edge of my seat watching us play. However our progress has been remarkable. We have a small tight squad and have been sensible with money. We will stay up and then we really need to build on our first season.,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Naturally pleased to see Roberts starting üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åø. But the overall formation and who plays where will again be a bit of a mystery but we must trust in Bielsa MOT üëç,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Roberts is a good back up. But, I really hope MB gets 2-3 of the young guns in once we are 'safe'. After all, it has been made clear we cannot spend 100 million every transfer window. Meaning, we need to be using lads like Gelhardt, Greenwood, Huggins and Summerville now, if they are to make a proper impact next season.",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Be great to see Roberts have a good game or score, do wonders for his confidence. Bench looks strong too, would like to see Gelhardt take a bow, and show us how he can perform on the big stage.. come on lads, lets take 3 points from these and get revenge for our home defeat, when we were the better side...üëçMOT",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Too right nice to see manager rewarding good performances ... Roberts,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Great see robets get his chance. Means alioski can come on later and cause issues with his pace. Hope dallas or Jamie in Phillips position. Hopefully get 3 pts much needed and a win for val,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Midfielder for a midfielder and Struijk back in his CB berth! Thats what i am hoping to see. That would be the right call! We need an extra creator in the centre as Wolves are going to set up defensively!,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Maybe Harrison might play lb Roberts on the left. He played there a few times for us before and played really well,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Tyler has a big chance to prove himself this evening - but I wouldn't be surprised if he's taken off at half time for Pablo (who can definitely do a job for 2nd half) #MOT,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
I'd like to see Dallas cdm he can make a good pass but are we going 4 4 2 with Robert's,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
I would like to see Hernandez on at some point. However Bielsa is not sentimental. Roberts needs game time. Tight game ahead but then again who knows with Bielsa s teams!!,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Always rated and been a fan of Roberts. Sometimes u just get a feeling about some players by the way they play the game and how they carry the ball n themselves on the pitch. And for me he's always been a good looking footballer (n I don't mean his appearance) which tells me he has what it takes to be successful!!! Slightly worried that it seems to be same defence tho!!! Hope I'm wrong!!! #MOT #ALAW,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
I reckon it‚Äôll be the same formation as arsenal game apart from Dallas taken alioskis role and roberts playing in midfield in place of Dallas. Hope not though prefer pascal In defence and Ayling getting down the wing with the attacks. Either way let‚Äôs get 3 points,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
I think he will put dallas at left back to use his extra pace against traore,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Let‚Äôs get into them from the off! Come on Leeds üíõüíô,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
I feel we may miss Alioski energy tonight but Come on Leeds,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Happy with that , Ayling/Raphina on that right side and Shack/Harrison on the other , Dallas holding in Phillips position..
Looks solid as we can hope for.. #MOT",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Surely Dallas at left back up against Traore. Big ask if Shacks has to play there.,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Come on Leeds! I feel the next 3 fixtures are key to the rest of the season,",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Klich in place of Pascal at CDM, Pascal at CB. Tyler CM with Stuart D",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
I thought I heard Hernandez was going to play must of changed plans,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Roberts played really well from the bench against Arsenal. Be interesting to see exactly where everyone is playing with this line up. My guess is Dallas to lb is the only major change, but who knows.",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Good luck Leeds, try and keep that defence tight especially in the 1st half and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get all 3 points tonight. Bamford to score again! üëçüèΩ",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Strujik CB please Ayling RB and dallas LB or wolves Winger are gunn kill us down the wing,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"If Lorente is fit , what is he doing on the bench? If he‚Äôs not fit , what‚Äôs he doing on the bench?",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"As much as I love Alioski, it's right to reward Roberts for his performance at Arsenal.",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"All the best lads, we are all behind you, ""at the end of every storm there's a golden sky"" never forget that.
I'm expecting a convincing win, Bamford & Rapinha pls I've got you in my FPL this gameweek, make me smile once again",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Obviously I trust Bielsa as our coach and manager but come on
Why Robert's over Pablo",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Dallas to lb surely and strujik back in the defence, shackleton in the Phillip's role?",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Nice cold pint in the pub with the mighty whites on üòé,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Would have preferred to see Hernandez get a game in the number ten role rather than Roberts. If Rodrigo isn't fit then surely Pablo is the natural replacement as a playmaker.

Expecting Neto to give us trouble.",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Come on Leeds, back to winning ways üíõüíôüî•. Let‚Äôs do it for kalvin and his family",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
We are in trouble again unfortunately. Paschal CDM and ayling moved to centre half..,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Good side except Klich is making too many mistakes & I'd change him,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Sorry but not keen on ayling in the middle of back four hes better getting forward down the line,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Should of put Dallas cdm roberts is lazy as well as klich,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Would have given Hernandez a start tonight always capable of changing a game .,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
I'd try klich in CDM Struijk CB Shackleton CM just for a half see how it goes.,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Just play the players in their natural positions ... struijk at CB and Ayling RB,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Happy with this to be fair. Dallas holding mid and pascal cb?,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Bamford and Harrison at CB
Raphinha in goals
Meslier at leftback
Cooper and Ayling up top
Has to be",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
"Does this mean Dallas is back at left back ? If yes, then Shacks must be in central midfield.",250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
if ayling is playing in cb we lose we need him bombing down the wing defence always looks dodgy with him at cb,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Not keen on struijk cdm rather of put Dallas there,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Come on Leeds !!!,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Probably Dallas at left back,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
Philips out another loss but i hope not,250,Wolves,Leeds,Away,-1
