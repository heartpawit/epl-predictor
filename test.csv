"Enough with Lacazette, play Auba down the middle and 4 in the back. Laca a waste of space and cannot take his opportunities. Every time the ball falls to him I have no confidence in him to finish",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"The information is not bad but we lack of creativity and this information can‚Äôt work with our lack of creativity.
I think Arteta need to bring Ozil back in January or he should sign another creative mild fielder.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I am still confused what the hell is happening with Gunners as I had great expectations from last match but it all shattered. If such trends keep on then we are at the verge of drowning.üòîüòîüòî,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
On Ozil Arteta got it wrong . You can't waste that gem. My team receive more beatings to pump sense to their decisions,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"There is no passion for arsenal funs!!!because again we going to lost one seoson more to get champion.!how cant see arsenal boss anf management team arteta dosent couch of arsenal..i think arsenal need to wait more years to get champion,,,!!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Another complete mess at home, giving our critics the opportunity to rant at us that it is the same arsenal with different players, but rightly so. I keep talking about the sharpness upfront and the poor mov't off the ball. But hey! It is my team, Arsenal. I hope we get over this quickly and most of all improve better. Villa just taught us what to do.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta is a tactical genius. He is amazing at his team selection. Greatest coach in the world. What place are we in? What has changed from last year when he took over. Trust the process? If this is the process then he‚Äôs gotta go.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Lame performance from an entirely average team . No determination , no team plan , no commitment , no focus . Every body is just playing to earn his income .
It will take Arsenal great time to become a great team again and competitive in EPL . You rushed to sell Martinez when Leno is so averaged .
I hate Arsenal's board under Kroenke with a passion. You killed Arsenal as you refused to strengthen the team .
Edu and co also have great blame for signing players of similarity in almost every departments . No player is assigned to do the dirty jobs even Partey that is noted for this stuff is playing the dead Arsenal's way , most unfortunate",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"What a disgraceful performance! Saka and Bellerin were weak. Holding the same. And why dont Auba play in centre? Pepe has delivered 10 mins of good play since joining the club. Laca looks done, and Nketiah still isnt close to be a player for a team that want to be, and sometimes tries to get on the upper half in PL.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arteta has decided to take out ..partey for cebalos poor very poor now there is no defence from the center ..most crosses that converted to goal came from center to left wing ..and converted to goals we are doomed at Emirates shameful..glory
to Martinez",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Clocks running low for the arsenals faithful ......... arteta and the board are making arsenal look fools again I just can‚Äôt see where arteta is taking this team I don‚Äôt understand his game plan ???? Arteta needs to pull something out this season or I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs arteta out,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Poses the questions:
1. Why is Abba playing as a winger?
2. Why is Pepe not playing? (3rd in goals/2nd in assists)
3. How is Ozil not up to it in ""footballing"" terms when we couldn't score if all 11 Villa players left the pitch ...
Absolute rubbish ... at least losing under Wnger was entertaining",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Can someone please explain how in the hell does the 5-2-3 formation good for this team?
The only thing it causes is a huge gap in midfield with no creative connection between defence and attack
- Tierny playing CB instead of LB is absoulte maddness, his crossing ability is excellent and a waste as a centre back, instead saka should play up front and replace Willian.
This formation is the reason this team does not score much in the PL!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Can we all just take a second to appreciate Elnenys resurgence under Arteta. What a player he has turned out to be. Especially with Partey along side him. Great partnership. üëèüèº,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arteta finally brings back the same team he played with in the last PL game, you can't just keep on blaming him for rotating the squad, even Klopp took 5 years to reach where Liverpool is today! And moreover just give Arteta 75 mil to bring in both Aouar and Szoboszlai and see what a havoc he creates! #COYG",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"If I am not mistaken, Arteta name his same line up as last game for the first time.

Pretty good enough. Fresh from wonderful match between City vs Liverpool, full of quick attacking and defensive masters. Hope Arsenal can do the same but score the goals pls.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"In a game like this I would of given Willock a start and leave Willian on the bench and leave out Xhaka completely, Willock has done well in the European games and deserves a chance in the league",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I lost interest in Arsenal the moment the Board started tutoring Ozil. Since then I always struggle to watch our games ... The passion is no more,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Three points please we can't afford to lose this one we must maintain our number or improve it on the league table, good luck",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Good balance team selection and a strong bench as well. We need to win to stay in touch at the top end.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willian needs to be dropped. You can't tell Pepe to work hard and win his place when Willian has not done enough to start,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I want to see PEPE,WI,AUBA,LA
CA BOOM. ALSO WANT TO SEE OUR MIDFIELDERS SCORING GOALS LIKE OTHER TEAM. 3 POINTS FOR SURE",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Finally crossing my fingers it's a 4 at the back system. We can get a more than 1 goal lead. All the best lads.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta is so naive n that will cost us dearly. .Why does he always bench Pepe n start with Willian? Hard to be n African in Europe.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Keep the winning 11.. Willian definitely drained .. all we have is a bit of experience from a tired leg. Hopefully Pepe or willock gets minutes to fight for the shirt in the second half,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This is unfair for Pepe, every time he delivers a great performance then he‚Äôs dropped to the bench irrespective of how Willian is performing",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Regardless of whether he‚Äôs in form or not, this is the type of game you pick Elneny for. Absolute engine who will hunt down our biggest threat - Grealish.
So pleased he‚Äôs finally getting the recognition he deserves.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I believe Pepe should be in the starting 11.He has been great. If we keep on benching him he will start having second thoughts and will have his mind elsewhere..,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Pepe should have start, William needs to step up, he hasn‚Äôt been aggressive enough on the ball for me. However every other players are in good shape..",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This lineup consistency means Arteta is edging to settling on his starting 11, which is great. All the best to the team. COYG!!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great squad there, let's pick the points early today, save us from 90 minutes of chest pains",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The match will start in 1:45 AM in our country.I am waiting not sleeping also I have work in the next day.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Sorry, Willian is playing like a veteran at the moment. He should be nowhere near starting. He brings nothing to the team, and offers nothing during the game.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I love Mo, bit part player, goes off on loan, comes back proves a point and now is a regular. Prime example of if you work hard enough you will get it. Reminds me a bit of Coquelin who did similar",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"3 at the back again. This makes me sick...We should go for 4 at back and start acting like a big and elite club again...It seems like we do timid with 3 at the back, to be honest...",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Unchanged squad for first time, we are going to get same result hope so",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Pepe should‚Äôve started over Willian but we get it Artetas signing given special treatment!!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Hoping for 4 goals today. Villa is a good side but arsenal is better. Going for a win,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The first time with the same team from last premier league match,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
One piece is missing... bring back Ozilüí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great line-up,this team will surely exploit villa,would have loved to see willock but I am sure Arteta has his reasons",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Chiefs lost again and I hope you guys are going to make my night please.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Holding X Gabriel solid, Elneny X Partey midfield bosses. It's 3 points in bag.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Pepe should be starting but apart from that I‚Äôm happy. C‚Äômon Arsenal!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Maybe Pepe should stop scoring/
assisting goals, because whenever he does he seems to get dropped lmao...ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£ but anyways... COYG!! üî¥‚ö™Ô∏èüí™üèª",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
This is the best squad we have had for a long time. Starting eleven is backed up with a formidable bench.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Same team for the first time, consistency is key.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Good to see he‚Äôs keeping this solid line up. Our best starting 11 for sure.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Only way this would be better if Pepe was in for willian, apart form that it is a great lineup and good to see him stick with El nenny with partey",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Good to see he kept a winning team. It‚Äôs the only way to get consistency üí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Apart for a couple positions that are debatable, this is probably our best 11 at the moment !!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Horrible team ! Lacazette and aubameyang are walking on the pitch and saka has no brain to play football !,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
No juice in this team... no creativity where 's the construction ..mentally also something missing... hey my Gunners you can do better,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
When will you guys realize Ozil did nothing for 90% of a game and certainly nothing defensively we cannot afford a luxury player like him!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Laca such a chance has to hit the Target.Otherwis
e his stay as a centre forward will be very short lived.What does he want to score.From Liverpool games he has been missing open chances.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
We don't need Williams & Laca in our squad.They are the problem facing our team We'll regret the action & face relegation if care is not taken,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We can see clearly what we do wrong on the pitch, all actions was going of the flank, so, atacking midfelder needed in our game, to play more in midle, to atack in that zone, If we play with Willock or Ozil like a 10, we can be more dengerous!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Seems like a good team selection, my only concern would be Willian and the fact that we have some really exciting young players that can‚Äôt seem to make the bench, let‚Äôs hope for a great game",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We miss ozil no creativity , aubameyang not interested playing on the right , you watch all the training videos they post everytime and ozil is training with the first teams and the one making the final passes for a finish but he can't play in any squad ü•¥ü§®",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"That is our strongest team at the moment, love it! Come on Arsenal! üí™",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta is right to maintain this team once again... Lets see if we gonna keep it up... Lets go gunners üí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Why does nketiah always make the bench he contributes nothing better to put willock or at least Cedric it's so frustrating,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"THE ARSENAL ATTACK IS COMPLETELY DEAD, NO FORCE, NO QUICK REACTIONS NO GOOD MOVE, NO GOOD ATTEMPT, PLAYING LIKE PRIMARY SCHOOL PLAYERS, ATETA NEED TO DO A VERY SERIOUS WORK ON THAT ATTACK, BECAUSE WITH THIS THE TEAM CAN NOT GO ANYWHERE..",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willian keeps on playing shiet but gets the nod...only player that seems undropable under mikel...swear if Mari doesn't play b4 January then definitely ozil omission wasn't arteta's decision,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
So why did we really Get Ceballos back on Loan??!!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
We need Ozil back on the team. No creativity at all.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The link between Partey and Elneny is working they can be able to stop Grealish since they were able to boss Pogba and Fred in the middle of the park and Gabriel a magnificent signing but the boys will win today our defense has improved this season just make sure the boys take one a game at a time and play the Arsenal way,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We need to change our style of football in order to achieve better results auba is a center forward,willian
is a free role midfielder nd wee need to be consistent",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I trust this kind of team selection from our own Mikel and happy to see a consistency in that . We gonna win the game,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
You lost today.. you better bring back Ozil.. This team is so annoying,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willian should do something reasonable tonight!! he has been a liability,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arteta‚Äôs selection and substitutions are very poor. What is Saka doing on the pitch. Elneny is not up to his game and instead of taking him off, he rather takes of Partey. Willian is performing well and Saka is not but he chooses to substitute Willian rather. Poor substitutionsüò°",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I hate to see Auba on the wing, Ceballos and Pepe on the bench. Arteta has got players to win games but he keeps using the attackers on the wrong positions. I just hope we win and not settle for a draw",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great line-up,but Pepe is the best over Willam.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Not a team! Never been a team! Got a few results by chance, and I'm glad the true Arsenal is showing up! Awful or do I say woeful....",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"The arsenal forward lacks consistency. Stick with
Auba, laca and Pepe game in game out.
Mid table team we should always use 3:4:3.. it will give the team the balance in the mid.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Absolutely rubbish this format of back passing doesn't work against small teams,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Very good this is the first team selection for us moving forward üí™üí™üí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
There is 3 kind of results in football...but today we need only one of them....that's wins only!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Genuinely one of the most inept performances I‚Äôve seen from an Arsenal team, the players just seem to care, they thought they just had to turn up after winning at Utd.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Our strikers should be much more lethal, while attacking for us to gain the 3 points.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
So happy to finally xhaka on the bench. Hope el nenny can maintain the same form like last week,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Should have put Runarsson in for Leno to give Leno a break because this team isn‚Äôt as good of a opponent and can‚Äôt always have the same goalkeeper every game they get tired just like every other player,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"PL needs one 11 squad, experiencing players happens during pre-season.
This kind kills the morale of players and we will never get a result.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"With a performance like this top 4 will be unachievable. The whole team was poor to say the least. If you can't beat Aston villa, it leave much to be desired. Disgusting!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Again conceding an early goal...We need to win...Come on guys...35 minutes have passed...It would have been 2-0..Please ensure 3 points...,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I‚Äôm quiet happy with this line up tbf would have been nice to see willock at least among the subs but come on arsenal 3 points please,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Saliba cant make the bench. A towering 1.90m fast defender that commited almost no fouls in french league. That boy can make our defence unbreakable if only arteta could see.training means nothing game day saliba can step up,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Apart from 2 assist in fulham game, Willian was excess baggage in the field. Cause he lost the ball twice and didnt win it back started our misery today's game.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This team is a real joke, no creativity, poor defense and mikel has more to learn, the team needs a real manager, Poch is available",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Tierney needs to play as the LWB not saka needs to be pushed further forward,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Better to use ceballose instead of lacazette, to improve creativity.
Then the formation should be 3_4_1_2, auba and pepe at the front.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This is our time to shine, this is the best line up so far ever since.... Please Mr. Arteta stick to it. Another 3 points to take",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
No need to change the winning Team that beat Man united...This lineups is Great.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Best team possible üî•
For those who criticize shut up once and for all ... False supporters ... Are you a manager? Arteta knows better than you. He does a great job. He brought in two great players Gabriel and Partey. He had the courage to kick out the parasites for the sake of the team. The team has become solid and it's getting better offensively even though there is still work to be done. A little patience, we are not on a game console ...

Go gunners!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Better from Arteta, same 11... Let's build the cohesion...",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Before we jubilate , remember this team Aston Villa smashed Liverpool 7 Goals .So don't underestimate it.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
We losing you mean its 0-1 half time we have no creation..... We missing a man he is home he have no invite to come.. #bringbackozil,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Anyone else think that the current formation is compromising the talents of the best players to accommodate guys that are not performing? It has been four league games since we scored from open play while losing two homes games in a row is not acceptable.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
It's a big mistake to all the entire team which was done in goalkeeping since from the time you decided to offload matinenze.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Fake lineups, willian, Lac and Ceballos they should not start at all!
Nile, Nketiah and Thomas, Holding is also very weak!!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Where is Ozil for heaven's sake?,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Coming here when we are already 1 nil down. Willian doesn't offer much. I hope he improves,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"The board playing politics with our best creative midfielder is bad , if they know they wanted to do this, then they should have brought money out for auora....",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Not comfortable with Willian pick though.. Willock better,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Stupid line up. Its fact. Boring boring arsenal. Mr arteta. Dont you see arsenal need AM. Where do you your mind???? Just sell auba, laza, william and also elneny. Just a bus passengers. Bring back ozil. Boring boring arsenal never change",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Consistency in team selection.... Nice!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"As funs we must accept the either three outcomes of the game,,,loose,wi
n or draw buh it's painfull when ours lose",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"When Saka can't play well, we hv no chances... The team is relying on 19yr old boy... The 19yr old boy is only the good player in the team ü§£ü§£
Where is the authority or fans who told William is the very good transfer for Arsenal??? If William is good enough to play in EPL, Chelsea won't bring Werner or Ziyech to EPL ü§£ü§£
Where is the one who pays 72Millions for Pepe??
Where is the one who told Laca is better than Giroud??
Where is the one who let Ramsey out and Thomas is like Vieira ü§£ü§£
Where is the one who tell Arteta is very good Coach??
No plan , No changes while losing....
Dont tell Villa has used money ü§£ü§£
Arteta is using the striker who has not played well in Championship ü§£
See how Wattkin plays, See Grealish plays... And also see Nkietia and Laca play, William and Pepe play ü§£ü§£
So funny
Arsenal is just the team that show disrespect to the fans",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Araenal has a small team mentality with Arteta. They play to not lose instead of playing to win!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"They scored as in 49 seconds and VAR saved us ...
Rescored us because of Holding .. He couldn't move to the guy before his pass for agoal
What a mess of tonight ... And am seeing they have dug a hole at right back of us",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Way to go,,we dont change a winning team
But
Let's try to create clear cut chances,, that's been the main problem",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"..And ELNENY is the melon you're avoiding to mention, the cause of the current turn of events, the failure we're facing now..but no one sees nor notices.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I expect the same level of commitment they displayed against a mediocrity team by the name of Man United,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great team selection. This is a sure win with at least a 3 goal difference, let's show Martinez some love with the goals üí™üí™üí™",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Small village park elneny can't boss
And is like party over for Thomas",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Just play Aubameyang central and see how we win every match.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
This is our best line up but I prefer Lacazette to come from the bench and Auba as our Number 9 Saka and Willian on the wings,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Willian is a tourist at Emirates stadium, not a player... he is the cause of the Villa goal. Easily loses the ball and has a very low work rate off the ball",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"What was that.. !!!! biggest waste of ¬£15 pay per view, villa at home! Disgraceful",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
That is the truth bro. Because of China politics but the club is losing its value at moment and it will continue.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Even when Pepe hasn't been top notch, he's still miles ahead of Willian. Pepe enjoy the bench man.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"How do you expect pepe to be consistent, when he doesn't get playing time, willian offers nothing, but yet you keep playing him, just because you the one that sign him. YOU are just ruining him",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
If saka is starting games and you can see his a talent why did we waste 72m on Pepe. Unai emery may God burn you in hell.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Mo elneny is back...and his really living up to expectations. ..... there's so many game to play this season .....xhaka should rest a lot...so when his called upon...he will give 100%,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Well balanced line up. I would prefer Pepe to start instead of Willian. Sure Pepe will come on at some point.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
But willian is not fit to start for our team,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"So Ozil was pushed to give way to hardworking people like William , this team is a clown ,Arteta out",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Villa wins 2-1. Second consecutive home defeat...Poor performance from the Gunners.. 4 Wins 4 Losses so far. Sad.
Pepe is overrated. Laca is not good enough.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Damaging.arteta
I urge you to seek coaching elsewhere.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
This line up got absolutely slated last week! And now everyone's rimming it üòè hopefully they put in a similar performance and we come out on top,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
This log called willian is like the electoral college vote of Nevada.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The entire offense could be built around Pepe and Auba crashing in from the wings... I'm guessing Arteta thinks they will be so compact Willian is required to break them down but that's kindof old school thinking at this point.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
All boys playing very hard for the team... This Blady Laca is waiting their hardworking efforts.....,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The reason why Arteta starts Willian and not Pepe is beyond me!!ü§îü§îü§î,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We're winning this, let's go for it sons.
#COYG",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
So where are all the people now that were freaking out about win over Man U and were laughing when I said this is only one game and that this tactic is not for the whole season and Arsenal won't be winning? Tactic needs to be changed and this tactic only be used for 5-10 matches per season,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Well done arteta you listened to us and social media...Elninny
and partey together companionship will be good.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Apart from the absence of Luiz, looks a solid line up.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I will never understand the math of playing Aubamayeng and Saka on the same wing. It's like playing one man less. Willian is a scam and even more lazy than Mesut √ñzil on the pitch, poor dribbles and less of a threat.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Players should at all times move forward not back passing for what.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Let's go get our 3points. Boys, keep an eye on Grealish, don't give him space like u gave Vardy.
Best wishes for the night lads.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
i always say aubemayang is not a winger arteta is a big fool we are struggling to score because our no 9 is being played on the flanks almost every team nowadays knows that when aubemayang is on the left flank he Will try to cut to the right then try to score so it is easy to mark him,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
How do we score with this poor approach.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Hoping Laca brings some form of confidence or belief in his own abilities. Otherwise he will be a liability,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Good line up, but my only problem is lacazette. I should have prefer aubameyang as the main striker, willock and William behind him .",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arsenal needs the creativity of Ozil, to lose to Villa at home it's so uncalled for.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
And it ended in Premium Tears....,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Aubameyang should be central striker! Sick of seeing him crossing it into the box when he should be in the box. Take Lacazette off and bring on Ceballos, Willian off and bring on Pepe if Willian keeps playing like this.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"COYG...Please play to win.. may all of you play as a team tonight.. ,so play smart...and today we want you create scoring target at AV goalmouth.

..",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
My only problem is playing Auba at the flanks. Nevertheless we are winning. COYG,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I thought willian would get a break to catch his breath pepe could hv started
Mo elneny starting is very good.
Cmon gunners lets get the 3 pts",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Ok... Something like Arteta has the winning formula ...he just don't want to use it.... I'm not feeling bad at all we are loosing the game...üò§üò§üò†,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willock for Pepe on the bench. He deserves the chance for PL game time. Pepe has not been able to play a final ball longer than 10ft all season,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Williams is a waste and we lack creative midfielder so always expect nothing from Aubumeyang and Laca,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
For the first time Arteta has found his team. kept the same lineup and formation,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta did not tinker with the lineup from last week. Nketiah is not a replacement for Laca. He is for youth teams.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Firs time Arteta repeat line up... It means Arsenal's will lose ü§ûüòèü§î,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3

"Ok, while I have my comments, much like many of you, about Arteta again dramatically (not just one or two players) changing the squad up which I‚Äôve always said never really allows the best starting 11 to jive and get synergy together by playing all the time together (our next match isn‚Äôt until Friday). The implications this year of the current status of tournaments is crazy. IF City win Champions and God forbid IF United win Europa then that opens up more opportunities below the top 4 to play in Europe next year and can you imagine the craziness if Chelsea finish in the top 4 but also win FA. This season is not over for us in the Premier league if we can put together a very strong finish. We have 21 points available, we play Everton and Chelsea, many teams above us play each other. If we could finish 6th I bet we would be in Europe and with the craziness, 7th May even get you in, at least a play in maybe. I think if we can finish with 60-65+ points we have a good shot at Europe. All this being said, I am very happy to see this attacking 4.

It's not about a bad reflection on trez. If you see it like that your not thinking straight.

"Trez has been playing well, will be good to see Traore, but I think Trez should've started. In Deano we trust. UTV.",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Should be starting Trez as hes a work horse and chases everything down. Southampton will press high and we will need our wingers to track back. I cant see Traore doing that üò¨,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Ha! If Traore doesn‚Äôt perform better be prepared to lose his place back to Trez.. or even AEG!,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1

"Think Trez needs a rest, worked his socks off in pretty much every game he's featured in so far... Sure he'll be gutted, but important to keep him fit for the whole season. I love the competition for places right now",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Sound team but if we play the same formation we did against Leeds we are going to struggle again down the right, cash was caught two against one for a fare part of the match, so traore has his work cut out for him..

Personally I'd go fro a 4-4-1-1, help upfront for Oily and enough in midfield to help out on the flanks",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Wow Trez is benched for Traore!!! Interesting to see, but must be harsh on Trez. Hopefully he won‚Äôt feel disappointed to be benched after his great performance with the team!",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Don‚Äôt agree with putting Traore in for Trez, we didn‚Äôt get the best out of Trez in his first season due to the in and out nature of his selection, he performed best after a run. Proof will be in the pudding I guess.",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"I have been so excited to see Traore in this line up, teams are struggling against us now that we have Barkley, as they can‚Äôt just double up on Jack and watch us struggle. But with Traores pace and creativity as well, and Watkins being so good at holding the ball up and his runs off the ball creating space, those three could be brilliant together. I like Trez, and he‚Äôs a big reason we stayed up last year with his form in the last 4/5 games, but Traore is in a different league. Jack and Barkley can run this game, with Traore and Watkins stretching the defence. Add in the fact that Mcginn and Luiz are both good from range, and excellent passers, but both protect the defence so well this really does have the makings of a real quality side. UTV!",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Don‚Äôt mean to be negative but Traore is just one of those players you know is a complete dud before he‚Äôs even kicked a ball. Hasn‚Äôt been great in his cameos and doesn‚Äôt seem to have any work rate. Apart from that I‚Äôm positive üòÅ,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
A bit harsh on Trez. But hopeful for a great start for Traore. UTV,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Harsh on Trez, his work rate has been phenomenal this season. Gotta see what Traore offers but will need to poor a shift in too - this team ain't carrying players this season",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Not sure this is the right game for his first start in league, Southampton will be pressing us all game. You won‚Äôt get a 3rd/4th touch in the middle of the park and need good work rate today. Needs to stand up and be counted, hope he‚Äôs up for it üí™",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Can easily adapt to 4-3-3, 4-5-1 or 4-4-2 if needed. Good to mix it up a bit and see what Traore can do from the off. UTV!",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Good news! Definitely need to see what he can do. Can his skill make up for Trezeguet effort?,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Feeling nervous Southampton are a good side but come on you villa boys!!,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Trezeguet is a lot better than them. He plays hard and supports defensively as well ü§î,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
Harsh on Trezeguet this is. He‚Äôs worked hard and has deserved his place in the team so to get dropped after we got dealt with by Leeds then that could have been half the team! Lets see if Traore is going to put a shift in...,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
"Trez has been decent, but excited to see Traore get a start.
Hopefully helps Cash out on the right hand side as Leeds massively exposed him before",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1

"Harsh on trez...think his defensive work has helped cash massively in the first few games!!....good
luck traore tho üôèüèª",61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1
I haven't seen a thing yet from Traore to suggest he's going to produce anything at this level! Doesn't look hungry and looks awkward and predictable when I've seen him play! Maybe there's a reason he was frozen out at lyon and the fans were delighted we took him,61,Aston Villa,Southampton,Home,-1

Says a lot for our team when we have 2 goalkeepers on the bench,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Gonna need extensions to benches for extra subs...,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Naming two keepers on the bench is just petty playground stuff from Dyche. Okay so he doesn‚Äôt trust another U23 to step up but that‚Äôs no excuse not to include one of them in the Match-day squad over Norris and give them a taste of it so they crack on and prove to him they are ready.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1

I just wish he would give Vidra a start.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Wood scored the winner v Palace with a one on one. He‚Äôs scored many goals for Burnley. Scores lots of headers from balls whipped in from the wide men. Unfortunately due to having to rebuild from the back after Ben Mee‚Äôs absence the quality of crosses from open play and free kicks has been lacking. Clarets are on their best run of form since last season and Dyche rarely changes the side unless an injury forces him to do so. Jay and Vydra also good players who will be chomping at the bit if they are needed later in the game. It will be a tough call tonight as Wolves generally don‚Äôt give much away at the back. Could be a 1-0 either way.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Is this a message to the board...2 keepers?!?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Sorry but Wood should be on the bench and JRod lead the attack with Barnes or Vydra. More to the point where is Vydra?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Why no Vydra I wonder,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
James Denslow - why not Jay Rod. Wood is so slow. No Vydra either - is he injured?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
That‚Äôs Vydra going in January then! Won‚Äôt see him again,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Like to j rod and Barnes I'd like to see vydra on and wood as subs,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1

Im a big fan of Barnes. But think Rodriguez would be better to start. ü§îü§îUTC,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Only Burnley could have two keepers and one attacking option on the bench. Why not use one of the under 23s to get them involved in the squad rather than 2 keepers?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
"Wood and Barnes, do me a favour! Got to be Wood and Jay for me, Barnes for impact from the bench. Wood going through a poor spell but at least you know what you're getting - Barnes offering absolutely nothing atm (cue glorious hat trick üôÇ)!",132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
"There‚Äôs no way that Wood and/or Barnes should be starting ahead of Jay-Rod based on current form.

If this is the strongest squad of players we've got we seriously need this takeover . 2 keepers 3 defenders and 3 kids is not good enough.

"Lampard reads games poorly, why do we keep playing Werner out of position, and can't sub him or Abraham for Giroud. This team is very poor!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3

It is a good start. The boys are displaying utmost game intelligence. This is a sure win for the blues,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
3-defeats in row! You not gonna beat Westham with Jorginho in midfield. He has not creativity to unlock their stubborn defence nor the physicality to match them. Lampard shot himself in the foot again. Good luck üëå,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"West Ham are a very solid team, especially Rice and Ogbonna defensively. It will take a lot of use of Pulisic with his finesse and technique as well as Werner with his speed to destabilize the block. Mount has to bring a lot to the midfield today and in terms of defense, it will take great communication with the goalkeeper and Chilwell's fine strides.üí™üèæ

Good luck guys ... We are with you and above all proud of you üíôüôèüèæüá®üáÆ.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"We have not lost a game Abraham has started ,good omen",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"My fellow Chelsea brother let's leave Giroud's talk, he functions better when we have all the playing to ourselves but we all know we lost that already, we need someone to get defenders under pressure by serious ball chasing and marking. Tammy has that just that he's wasteful but that's not just our problem, the whole Frontline has been wasteful",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3

"So mount can‚Äôt rest ü§î, why I see ppl talking on here saying mount fighting for his place in this team and he earned when really and truly he haven‚Äôt it was given to him idc what nobody says ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÖüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, lampard need to be back in the championship",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Jorginho is underated but he is very creative in the midfield nd can defend as well lets give him a chance too,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Start Abraham because he is the father of many Nations right? Okay!! Lampard dares not lose this game. Mtcheeeeew!!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Werner should be striker. Odoi and pulisic wingers. Ziyech replace one of the wingers when he is fit. Giroud is reserve striker or even partner Werner. Tammy have to wait or play in the u23.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I don‚Äôt know what Game Lampard was watching but if it was the same wolves and Everton game then he is not someone that learns from his mistakes
Hopefully he wins
Cuz we can‚Äôt finish 9th before new year",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"The fact that Chelsea is turning to a childish club is really heartbreaking

Slow Jorginho running the midfield against Declan Rice?
Tammy should go on loan to a Championship team again b4 he'll be ready for big team like Chelsea.
I prefer to play Wanner as a top striker and not a winger cos we're getting absolutely nothing good from him at the moment, Lampard is the one turning Wanner to a flop.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"It's a 'okay' starting XI although I would've loved Kovacic ahead of Jorginho and Giroud over Tammy. Let's just see how it goes, even with our best line up we can still lose game but I'm optimistic.

Great to see Hudson-Odoi back from his injury - hope to see him come on in the second half in case we need him! ‚úÖ,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Justice done. A cameo for Giroud and Kovacic will breath a new lease of life to the game. The boys are raring to go that's for sure. We will miss Reece big time,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Best lineup,,,happy to see jorginho starting,,he is the only player in chalsea apart from ziyech who can feed Werner a pass that suits his strength.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Lampard should be included in the a thousand ways of death. Why start Abraham and Jorgi ahead of Giroud and kova respectively. MADNESS MADNESS MADNESS MADNESS,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Glad to see Pulisic & Azpi back, hope their are 100%. I would really preferred Hudson to start instead of Mount. Lastly i hope Werner will be at his best level for goodness sake.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Abraham?! really,....we need someone who will take one chance and burry it.... Werner has played alot and i bet he's tired....wish kovacic and Giroud could have started....Anyw
ay All the best BLUES üíôüíôüíô",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I would have loved to see Giroud start ahead of Tammy, but I hope he comes good in this game.

Azpi may struggle to deal with the pace of West Ham attackers down the right flank.

Otherwise, I think it's a good lineup on paper.

Whoever plays, I hope they give it their best. Let's win this.

Go Chelsea!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Allow Mount to rest. Why should it always be about him? Am sure he also needs to rest and there are better players on the bench. Sometimes Frank is just too biased.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Wait what's special about this Abraham that boy is not a footballer he isn't even qualified to play our street ball,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Can someone tell frank that werner is stricker!!! Am sure Lampard will loose his job because of being stubbornness!!!
Tammy in center forward? What a f....ck!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Abraham starting ahead of Giroud?, Werner at the flank again?, Jorghino ahead of Kovacic? Lampard is a big joker and he will be sacked just like others no matter the legendary status he holds at Chelsea. We want results not experiments on English boysüò°üò°üò°",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Nice seeing Abraham back to the starting line up. We have lost 2 of the last 3 EPL games giroud has started so let's revert back to the old ways please. My only concern is jorginho destroying the rythm that midfield already has.

Victory all the way certainly",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Behind the manager as I have been behind when we were winning games,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"A very strong lineup but you should have started kovacic over jorginho Geroud over tamy Apraham apart from that the rest are good.....Some plastic fans here are saying Lampard out, plz let us give him time the way Liverpool gave klop enough time.....",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
This line up is not solid enough to give us 3 points at the bridge and iam afraid the hammers will give us problems. Let's emulate what Livers and the Zebras did on the weekend by scoring more goals. lord Giroud could have been in the starting lX. Otherwise the Zebras put up a good performance yesterday and could be the favourites to win the EPL title if we don't play our cards right!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"My Only Wish Is For Chelsea To Get A Better Coach, Who's A Master Tactician, Experienced And Doesn't Have Favouritism, That Way We Wont Lose To Top Half Opponents, Lose Unnecessarily, Have Players Out Of Their Natural Positions And Have Crazy Line Ups Like This One...

I Really Wish...",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Good that giroud is having a rest need him for the up coming games but shouldn‚Äôt put Abraham upfront should have werner,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"West Ham have big players and I don't think jorginho will be able to match their strengths in the midfield. Kovacic would have been a better option
We can win this and get our season upright again

"I think there is a conspiracy between Lampard and Abraham, Chelsea needs to investigate Lampard, it's irritating benching Giraud for The lazy Abraham",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3

Disappointed not to see Giroud and Kovacic in the starting XIüòî and happy at the same time to see Havertz on the benchüí™üëèüòé,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why would you start Jorginho in a high intensity game? Abraham starting? Whichever,win or Lampard will face the wreath of an african witch",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why benching Giroud? This favoritism have to stop now, or someone will go back to Derby County",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
When is Werner gonna play striker instead of being wasted on the wings,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"What will help us in this match is if we take our chances well in the earlier stage, we would surely be victorious.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Cm'on guys.. My concern is that, if Pulisic is playing left wing. I really don't care much where others are playing. A must win game",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why did you delete the earlier post and posted it again, maybe we need our admin out alongside Lampard.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What type of formation is this?? Where is Giroud???,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Poor team selectionüòü‚òπÔ∏èüöÆ, how is mount better than kovacic? werner out of position, kante will surely suffer today.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why bench Harvetz?Why Mount in the mid...

Another lose. Lampard out.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why Abraham lazy boy walking in the field nkt,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Cannot see us winning this one with abraham up front Lampard has no clue playing players out of position time should be main striker,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Chelsea should go with false 9 instead and put Werner infront with Haverts and Pulisic on the wings. Giroud should honestly come on as a second half player just to push the attack more. Kovacic should start in place of jorginho with kante holding the midfield alongside him. Mount plays an attacking role. I really think Lampard should think more from a players perspective(suc
h as its traits and abilities and comfortability as well). Chelsea has a good team but they not just playing their role really. Ive been a chelsea supporter all my life and I can say that players are playing better when they playing their role and play freely",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Really today Timo Werner gonna score goal because Jorginho is there but also whole team we need a good performance on this game so as to rescue the victory on this game.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Sometimes this Lampard looks confused. Why play Jorginho when we have Kovacic. Why play Abraham when we have Giroud. Why play Mount when we have Havertz. We seriously need 3 points please. But I can smell a defeat of 1-0,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Mount must b a superman..alway
s available..neve
r tired..plays all wings..won't b surprised to c him in goal sumday...",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Hope big Tammy score tonight and hope Werner gets back on form, come on lads lets do this tonight üîµüîµ",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Omg tonight we are playing with 10 men Tammy should not be any where near the fist team, dream or loss tonight for sure",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"just watched first half and week by week the team are getting worse no pressing , very few tackles, every thing passed back into a packed midfield, as much as i admire lampard i think this has come to soon for him, we need players that give 100%not just drift in and out of games.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"We displayed our best arrangement in defense with Kante in front of back four, Cova, Mase in the middle and the three attackers Timo, Pulisic Verner and Tammy / Giroud. Ziech and Havertz could come in as subs
When Chilli and Reece are fit they can replace Azpi and Emerson.
Also it is good to have three other subs competing for full backs.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"It a bad lineup why this cow Abraham and This old guy why James not playing

Lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampard lampardüöÆüöÆüöÆüò™üíîAnd if we lose today he must go üöÆ",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"if he starts us with that slow crap across the back, the game is over, we need to attack and counter attack at speed with numbers and remind kante he isn't a striker, but is the worlds best defensive midfielder. lastly, pray tammy don't get in the way of Werner and Pulisic and it don't take 20 tries to get one on target.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I wanna see Mount's contract, maybe it has a clause that says he should play all the games. Almost everyone can be rested except for him",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Abraham has to be on bench and instead Giroud to start simply because Abraham does nothing in the field but just to fill the number to be 11. Useless striker,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Good line up, I think Giroud and Kobacic will be a good addition in second half. Lampard should be make sure that his team win the first half with a good goal margin.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
So what is jorginho and Tammy doing on the lineup? Lampard doesn't learn from his mistakes at all. No creativity or whatsoever in the midfield if jorginho is present. Westham will dominate the midfield against us. Lampard must be serious with his team selection.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What the hell is Jorginho doing on the pitch?? Why is Kovacic on bench?? Lampard is the problem why we are loosing...n,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I love it when the team sheet is announced.

I have a mental bet with myself about who everyone will moan about before I click the comments.

I thought Abraham but I see Mount is the name on everyone‚Äôs lips again. It‚Äôs been a while. Half you lot will never be happy.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I will not stop saying lampard his mount elder sister's boyfriend because I don't know why he cannot rest him and use other players to give us result we have better players on the bench make use of them learn from your mistake and do something new man,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Chelsea needs a good coach, how can you bench Giroud who always score. For Chelsea to win trophies, Lampard must leave.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What has happen to us. The more games I watch the more I see that the overall pace of the Chelsea play has completely gone! We used to pass and move so quickly. Soo boring and so what predicable. We no longer have a counter attack at all!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why Jorginho instead of Kovacic who was our best player last season?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"We r going to win no matter what, but I prefer Giroud over Abraham and we need ziyech back ASAP to form perfect trio with Warner and Pulisic",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
We need a top coach who raise the spirit of players and motivate them in order to be fully a title contender surely,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I thought lampard said we have to bounce back to winning way, what is relationship between jorginho and winning waysüòí",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Mendy needs a performance today last 2 games hes been a liability. At fault for the penalty at Everton and should of saved the one he got a hand to against wolves.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Different game, same experts, same rubbish to read. Are you people never tired to complain. Do you think you know better than Frank knows. Look at you and look at Lampard. Can you see difference? It is time to shut up.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Hope we adapt to amore fast way of passing, the ball with purpose and ugue",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"This man is playing to lose ü§£ .. it is more than evident that Tammy doesn‚Äôt have the skill capacity to influence a game or even benefit the team, why is he playing?",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Timo Werner is a central forward ,why is Lampard playing him on the flanks. Tammy should be substituted for Giroud we can't take favouritism no more. Mount always on the starting line up,he needs a breather",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Love how the Chelsea admin removed my post! Everyone is entitled to their own opinion,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Good line up, Giroud and Kobacic will be a good addition in the second half.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"If chelsea really wanted to win this game for me Giroud would av started ahead of Abraham ,then Kovacic would av grabbed Mount's and james to start ahead of the captain (Azpi)..this lineup may fail to give chelsea the expected results but chelsea win then it will be a suprise",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"The only good thing is Jorg5 in the starting eleven, Mount and Tammy shouldn't have started the game, instead gird and perhaps kovacic should have started,",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I would love to see kovacic on mount's place, mount on the right wing,werner as the striker abraham out.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Lampard came to his senses and realised Giroud is not a starter but a super sub , that's how he's best utilised we may not like it as fans but it's the truth. The dropping of Havertz sents a message to team no one is undroppable.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What is Mendy doing between the sticks ?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Chelsea should win please so that those United fans won't burst my ear with taunt üò¢üòî,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why start Abraham when Hudson odoi is back..
Frank lampard always doing some silly mistakes",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I like chelsea to lose this game to teach Lampard how to line up players ......on their natural positions!!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I wonder how many chances he creates, goals/assists he has for him to start every game as the teams number 10",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I've just finished taking my beer for the night. You never can tell what will happen watching Chelsea these days. They might ruin your appetite..
Just hope they get it right this night",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Honestly I hope this line up opens up a resolute Westham. We will keep possession for sure but will we breakdown their defence?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I don't know but I'm not just comfortable with this lineup!,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"In this kind of game, what we need Mount for is not really hard work but creativity.. If Pulisic does not create anything, I really wonder where creativity will most likely come from. I think Mount in particular will need to convince us that he can create at atleast. Especially if Westham game plan is to pack bus, how then will hard work be needed.. That has been the cry and demand of many fans",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Lampard will always make excuses for why other players must rest, including Timo and Kai, but NEVER for Mount, who leaves his basic midfield role and thinks he is a striker.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Is Giroud not the striker that scored against Wolves? Is he not the striker that has scored 9 goals on his last 10 games his started. How does Mount get in ahead of Kovacic, yet Mount has a habit of disappearing like he did against Wolves.
When will Lampard realise Werner is struggling out wide and last and definitely least, why is Abraham still starting? I think Lampard is tired and is pushing to be sacked and just doesn't know how to say ""i cant do this""",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Giroud performs better as super sub, good selection gaffer.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Tammy will be eaten alive by their centre backs. Timo should play as centre forward, his ability to run behind those tall centre backs.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Y is lampard playing Werner as a winger when he shd play number 9. Pulisic shd play left wing ad odoi right wing,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"To be sincerely honest In my humble opinion without being sentimental and of course, without offending anyone who thinks differently from my opinion but rather looking into this critical issue with perspective distinction and without condemning anyone's point of view I honestly think and believe that I sincerely have nothing to say",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Don't think we're strong enough, thought he would of stuck with giroud, rest werner, & mount, kovacic for jorginiho only my opinion.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
We don't need Giroud to start. The man needs to be rested. For me this line up is spot on.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"So annoying to see jorginho playing as lampard then plays Kante out of position. Playing so many players out of position:

Pulsic
Werner
Kante
Dave",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I really don't understand this line up. If we should lose this match, we won't take it easy on Lampard",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"All the best Chelsea....i feel the pain to seen Uncle Giroud on the bench...anyway.
....",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Timo Werner, man you got to be the player we bought you for.
And please can someone tell Lampard that chances are created in the opposition box, not playing in your own half!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Timo waster I don't think he has been working on his finishing why, now if the defenders don't score then it means either we draw or lose why Chelsea front line aaa",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"This coach doesn't even listen to us, taking Timo to wing again and expect him to do well

Why not Pulisic Werner Odoi?

Or must Werner even start every match?

Why not Pulisic Tammy Odoi?

I'm sick and tired of this Lampard guy o",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
What about James?. Is he injured?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"With Mendy and Timo starting, i don't see Chelsea winning this game. Lampard still finds it difficult to place a good team line ups.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Not satisfied with team selection
Hopefully we win because the three points is needed",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3

what the hell is Odoi and Giroud doing on the Bench? If we loose this match erhhh i'll be travelling to London from Cameroon to have a crisis dialogue with Lampard and the board.. Benching a Natural winger what for?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Sorry to say this,if the wingers are not performing the midfield should help,we lack midfielders that can shoot from outside the box,create killer passes,look at Bruno,debryneüòîüòî,oh God,and then we have kovacic that last scored 5years ago,jorginho that can't pass neither can he shoot",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why bench Havertz?
When players are struggling you don't bench them for the sake of their confidence. He needs time to adapt to the league but he won't adapt from the bench. Too bad Werner is on the flanks again but I hope Chelsea wins regardless of who ever is in the line-up. #KTBFFH üíô",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
About time Cesar back in the starting lineup far better defender than James,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3

"Werner should take his role as no.9 point man. Lampard learn from history.
December has always been a struggling period for Chelsea fc.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Instead of utilising Hudson on the wing then put timo centre hes done it again well i hope we lose need a new manager,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Another fake line up. .what the hell is jorghino doing in that mid field...Werner out of position again... lampard out!ü•∂ü•∂,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3

"Werner Still Out of position,....Wh

I don't know what Abraham and Jorginho are doing on the field. They should have gone for early Christmas üò†,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Today is the game to confirm whether we have lost track in title chase,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Why was Werner bought if our strikers were going to be Abraham and giroud.Why dont he try Abraham on the wings as he does to Werner every game this is very unfair.I never saw lampard playing defence or goalkeeping or striking at Chelsea.Abramov
ich please have your red pen close today.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Pulicic is never effective on the right....werner
is not a winger, everything seems wrong",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I'm not pleased with the selection Mr Lampard.
Why starting the attack with Abraham who has proven to be useless in the last 3 games?
Giroud has proven to be the main guy in the last few games and you benched him üò≤
Keeping Kovacic17 on the bench and starting with Jorginho5 is like playing another version of Havertz alongside Kante and Mount... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Since Callum is fit, why didn't you play him in RW and play Pulisic in the LW?

See what Burnley is doing to Wolves that dealt with us...
That shows it was very stupid of us to loose that game...

This is an important game which we need to win after we foolishly lost the last two and you choosed this players to start???

I hope we win this game üôè

"Lampard u just messed up;this was not what i was expecting,u've really dulled my spirit for this game . Jorginho starts! For a game like this; I expected Kovacic. Not only that I expected u to play werner as CF today and Anjorin as left winger. NO! NO! NO! Lampard u may cost us the title. Let see how ur game plan works.
#KTBFFH",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"2 loses and Lampard is already confused, he doesn't know which players to field",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why TIMO out of position?? HUDSON ODOI is available,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
How do u expect werner to play as 9 when our wingers are injured and not fit. Some people talk as if they don't watch football all u know is after the match the next thing is lampard out,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I'll just wait for the final score before I run my mouth...... I suggest you all do the same üòï,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Chelsea played badly..very lucky to get 3 goals at the death of the match.. majority of the match they played badly.if westham were a good team they would have equalized and probably taken the game away from Chelsea before those two late goals came in....wener has been the most wasteful striker or should I say unlucky striker in the premier league this season..he needs to start taking his chances and help Chelsea kill off games on time or else he will cost Chelsea loosing or drawing games they should have killed off,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Where have all these crybaby fake fans come from. Either you support the team which means you support all the players in the squad and the manager. If you can't do that go support someone else.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3

I‚Äôm not complaining about the selection but I‚Äôd like to see us playing 4-3-3 with Kovacic in for Mount,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
This game we need strong playes like Giroud and Kovacic not Jorginho n Abraham,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Does anyone know of another Chelsea page I can follow that isnt full of plastic fans saying moronic rubbish like 'Drop Mount,' or 'Sack Lamps,'. So much anti English sentiment yet you say you follow an English team. So many muppets on here it's unreal.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why bench a striker thats way better than Abraham,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Wait who's watching this game what's the usefulness of Abraham,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
In league games with giroud possibilities of winning are always 0,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Very weak in the midfield nothing world class about it.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"If Lampard will one day be sacked by Abramovic I'll fully support that.
Lampard is digging his own grave
How can you bench Giroud for lazy Abraham",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Come on guys we have to win this. Blue is the colour,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Why must Mount and Jorghino start Lampard lacks a game plan,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"They won't tell you that Mason Greenwood has more career goals than Pulisic.
The pain will remain in the rented stadium.
Mark this.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
All d EPL matches Giroud started we kept losing is good we use Abraham that makes us win each time he starts,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Guys, what is happening about KOVACIC, he mostly play from the bench this season. And he is one of our last season First Eleven player. He move forward with ball and he is a serious player but Lampard don't used to start him this season.
Maybe he's not from England",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Biggest mistake is Giroud on bench.... atleast captain America is in ....All the best Chelsea... waiting for lampards sacks news soon...no trophy can this guy will lift with such forcing players to perform yet without form but lefting good players outside eg Alonso .,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Very poor selection Abraham is very sluggish lampard should have Play werner 9,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Where is Papa Giroud? üòè,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
A good line up for Chelsea bt Lampard could Giroud more than Abraham,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Can anyone tell me what Werner is doing in Right wing? Why kovacic on bench. This is too much.,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Lampard is a crazy coach ... What so good with mount ??! Zero goals , zero assist . Yet Chelsea number 10 choice??? . Tammy the falling striker üôÜ... Even if we win ,, we will struggle getting goals üò≠ . Mad lampard.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
I understand that Giroud is a better sub but why is Kovacic on the bench?,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Mount and Abraham don't deserves to play for Chelsea, they are both worst players at Chelsea. Don't know why Lampard is benching Giroud and Havertz",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
But why start this cabbege abraham will lose agian,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Today i will stop my support for the Blues our goals are different I want to win not to build someone that am not sure of his future,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I really do nit understand, we bought a scorer and he never plays in his position?",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"This is how to make Kai Harvetz grow.

Never start him... bring him on at 83 minutes when you are 3 up!",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"Chelsea will play better today without havertz and kovacic...frank
bring in pulisic and jorginio tammy...we have runners...can bring on giroud as a sub...good frank",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Meanwhile No one has scored more goals for us than Olivia Giroud Despite playing about Half the Minute of Timo Werner but ok sure Let's go back to the man Child Abraham... Lampard is obsessed with this Tammy of a guy,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
Kovacic is is one of our best midfielder but he is always on the bench. If we don't win this game Frank will be in trouble,133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3
"I see Abraham in the starting line up, after all Lampard is a dog that always go back to its vomit.",133,Chelsea,West Ham,Home,3

"Expected line up except Davies instead of Delph. Hope he steps up and shows he‚Äôs he‚Äôs good enough although I have my doubts. Think Delph is not fully up to speed after long lay off.

"Up to Davies to put a performance in now, was expecting Delph but I trust Carlo to make the right move. COYB",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Last time we won 4 in a row we won the league didn‚Äôt we?????,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Well done lads, great performance. Special well done to Tom Davies who I thought had a really solid game, in the middle of the park and did well at right back too. Keep the boo boys quiet for a couple of weeks anyway.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Iwobe made a brilliant chipped cross to assist James‚Äô first goal of today‚Äôs brace. Both are playing well and aggressively, and making numerous skillful attacking threats.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"69th minute, at 3-1, NBC EPL commentator: ‚ÄúHats off to Tom Davies. Brilliant bit of defending there‚Äù as a saved shot 4 yards out and central in the goal about to be cleanly struck by an opponent was cleared by Davies. 70th minute: a brilliant crossing chip by Abdoulaye Doucour√© assists James Rodriguez to send Everton to a 4-1 lead, likely assuring Everton‚Äôs first top-flight season-opening 4 straight wins since their title-winning 1969/70 season.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"How long will they stick with Pickford, a total clown that will bring the rest of the lads down with his constant error after error, but they still play him, something wrong somewhere !!!",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Defensive options nearly non existent on the bench. Suppose that's why Davies is getting a chance. Makes sense as Bernard would make a better impact player if needed. Delph would be back up for Doucoure and Nkounkou can slide in at left back if Digne needed at center back. Hope the boys stay focused in this one... COYB...,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"I'd love to know what Tom Davies does in training to keep getting picked when shirt available obviously because for me he offers nothing in the game..never a forward pass,an attacking run,shot on target or assists for others..It's something that baffles me..Hopefully an win today tho blues even with him in the team..UTFT.NSNOüíô",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Davies should be shown the door, constantly loses the ball in our third, responsible for god knows how many goals against last year, get rid",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

"I do hope tom davies plays well today and prove some doubters wrong. But we have to get behind carlo and his decision. Glad richarlison is fit to play. Trossard and maupay have been playing well for brighton, must keep them quiet today. Siggy pull some magic today. Doucoure same again from you in midfield, and the front 3 speaks for itself üî•üî•üî•. 3 points is a must. Keep it going toffees üíôüíôüíô",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"I'd personally have Delph holding and Bernie in the free role.

I'll be all over this if Davies and Siggy have stinkers though üòÇüòÇ.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
In carlo you should all trust if he chooses davies then he knows better than anyone on here thats why hes a winner a serial winner,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Davies is in the team because he earned it in training. Carlo said it‚Äôs training that gets a player picked. Davies has had a bad 12 months since he broke onto the scene but he‚Äôs a blue and Carlo wouldn‚Äôt pick him if he didn‚Äôt believe in the lad. Look what he did with Bolasie. Let‚Äôs trust our amazing manager,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Get behind the team before you start moaning players are playing who you wouldn‚Äôt pick! Carlo picked them it‚Äôs his choice not yours after all we‚Äôve won every game this season and still the negativity!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Sorry but i would not let Davies near the squad, nowhere near good enough the way we are playing.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Goes to show that missing one vital player (Allan) can change the dynamics of the whole team. Anyway, Davies will need to prove himself today because i don't think he'll get many more chances this season. COYB",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Honestly, Tom Davies in the team is a complete joke I don‚Äôt care if he scores six or has a stinker or he is a local lad- he has proved over 100 games that he simply isn‚Äôt good enough.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Great to see the support from our brilliant fans slagging one of our players off before the game has even started, pure kopite behaviour!",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Looks a good solid side Davies is a bit of a worry for me but he might try today I like sigurdsson and hope he can pull of some magic and I would love to see Pickford have a good game today,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Carlo angel lotto has managed some of the best players and teams in the world and obviously feels Davies can do a job for us today so I‚Äôd rather go with his judgement on mine and likewise I‚Äôm sure he will whip him off too if he‚Äôs not doing what Carlo asks for,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Delph had to start over Davies. I can't see any place for Davies in the squad moving forward,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Well at least we have that front 3 and the energy of dacoure in midfield so a comfortable winüëç,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"For all you Davies knockers, he must be doing something right in training. I know he has a good attitude so you have to trust Ancellotis judgement. These anti Davies fans have probably moved on to Davies after they were proved wrong about DCL",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"From a Brighton fan, best of luck today to Everton. Great to see you guys having such a good start to the season. If we can avoid gifting you silly goals and not hit the post 5 times then this should be a brilliant game. I think it‚Äôll be a close one. If we come away with a point I‚Äôll be delighted.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Yes, it‚Äôs Tom Davies and we all have our opinions on him ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è BUT, one person doesn‚Äôt make a team win or lose, it‚Äôs a team game and I‚Äôm sure other players will up their games if needs be to cover for him, so let‚Äôs just get behind them and cheer them on üëäüèª COYB üíô",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Tom Davies and Sigurdsson together is going to provide nothing!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
I wonder if the people knocking Davies are the same ones who slated DCL last season . ü§î,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Stop the negatively people lads get behind the players tom Davis is not the best but he is an Everton player,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"We are at home so pick an attacking line up, Bernard should be ahead of Davies, he can't do anything productive!! Disappointing",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
I‚Äôd have played Delph before Davies!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Just when I was starting to sober out they put bloody Davies in the team, 50 mins to KO better start on the lager now FFS.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Hope Davies and Sigurdsson play complete blinders to shut us all up but I just can‚Äôt see it from Davies. Siggy has it in his locker for a worldy goal or a bit of magic from a set piece but I fear Davies is well out of his depth. I hope I‚Äôm proved completely wrong and the lad plays brilliantly. We shall see. COYB!! üíôüëäüèª,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

That central midfield is worrying. Doucoure got a lot on. Need to see Mina put in a performance with the new signing imminent. Great to have competition and starting players need to step upüíôüíôüíô,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Would have preferred Delph instead of Davies,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Not for me to question Don Carlo, but there‚Äôs not a chance I‚Äôd have Tom Davies near that starting 11",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"We need to be careful today, Brighton battered United last week!",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Davies instead of Delph is a weird one. Doucoure has to be on it today because Davies runs round like a headless chicken, doesn't tackle anyone and gives the ball away.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Well Brighton have a chance üò¢ Let's hope he can actually find a blue shirt today, and not give any silly fouls away outside our box.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Even played Bernard in middle before davies,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Glad to see Davies get a start! Really think Carlo will get the best out of him and help him become the player we know he can be!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
I just don‚Äôt get it how on Earth is Davis playing he offers us nothing in midfield,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
All good .. but why Davies and not Delph or Bernard ...,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"The team must be aiming for a win, but should also be vary of complacency. Plus trossard needs to be kept on a check. When we went away to brighton last season, his introduction at half-time single handedly turned the game around against us. And pls have mercy upon us tom davies!",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

"Would have preferred Delph in for Davis, hope this team is strong enough to win today, Allan, Gomes are big misses.",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Midfield looks so much weaker. Even with doucoure in there it doesnt look composed enough,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Would prefer Delph over Tom Davies but in Carlo we trust coyb,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
The fringe players need to be playing at 110% capacity today. Lights camera action!!!!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Not a bad team but wouldn't of played davis from the start,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Nearly every comment below is of pure shock or about Tom Davies or both ü§¢ü§Æ my stomach actually turned when I seen he was anywhere near that team,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
One of the reasons klopp has done well is he has his players playing like a gang of mates who'll die for each other. Now Carlo has got an everton team who appear to be like this ( but with more talent) so can WE become part of this team and if you must critisize make it constructive!,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Playing in team with confidence and better players, hopefully bring the best out of Davies, just get behind Carlo‚Äôs selection COYB",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

Then what?

But - In Carlo we trust üíôüíô",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

Come on . Be objective. Tom Davies simply can‚Äôt make it at this level. Delph would have been a better starter. üòÉ,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Won‚Äôt be long until delph gets subbed on for davies,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Delph or Bernard should have been picked ahead of Davies,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
How about people stop complaining about the line up and just back the team!It is a squad after all and not just 11players,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
"Davies has nothing to lose, everything to gain.. have some faith.. hopefully I‚Äôm not eating these words at FT",34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
might have been tempted to give delph a start after his performance against west ham,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Can the back up brigade deliver? Acid test today...won‚Äôt be a walk over.,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2
Massive game for Davies today. Would imagine Doucoure will drop back to DM with Davies taking the 8 role. No Kean? Is he injured or on his way out?,34,Everton,Brighton,Home,2

That performance was a disgrace. No heart. Technically inept all over the pitch. Last two home games were relegation form. Not one player can walk off that pitch with pride. Utter garbage,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"godfrey has played well but we need more attacking threat today from full backs so understandable to play coleman and digne
midfield is more offensive so should improve us offensively and on paper it seems logical to do that against a poor newcastle team but time will tell.
we certainly need a new striker or wide offensive player to come in to give us more options and would be better keeping bernard until end of season send gordon out on loan instead he has not played particularly well in the few opportunities he has had lately he has ability though and needs more game time at another team.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Looks like all out attack today, these are the sort of games we need to win by 4 or 5 goals we always seem to win by the odd goal.COYB. Looking at the banch I think Bernard and tosun may be off in the next few days",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Strong side. Happy with that. We have to be on top of our game today, can‚Äôt be too complacent against bottom side teams. Must win. James to be MOTM and DCL and richarlison to score. Hopefully clean sheet and pickford to come back strong after what happened the other night. COYB üíôüíô",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Why is Pickford still playing after another howler on Wednesday when we have a great backup in Olsen,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Look at that bench, if ever a team needed more forwards...as for Pickford, support him or support someone else! I see no one‚Äôs really questioning why DCL & Richy start after not scoring those chances v Leicester",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Looking forward to seeing us beat the toon it's a good line up to play resting Godfrey and Holgate will be ok we have strength in defence my only concern is pickford he doesn't do well against them would have liked olsen in goal,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
See our squad needs 1 or 2 players in by Monday otherwise we are going to struggle if injuries take over,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Bernard and Tosun üëã don‚Äôt mind Godfrey on the bench boys, give the kid a rest. This Newcastle team is gonna sit and we need Luca‚Äôs running in behind to open doors. Ben is a better defender but shite going forward without acres of space in front of him to kick and run like forest gump! Shouldn‚Äôt say shite really, just not as good as Digne at it! COYB!!!!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Interesting bench and tells you hopefully what you need to know on the Bernard and Tosun front. Finances must come first during the pandemic (especially considering the deadwood that's still being subsidised / paid off) and with Allan (Gbamin eventually more for next season and Delph) back soon it's a solid 15 or so first team but really hope we can pick up another number 9 on loan come the close of Monday (Dzeko) and then sort out Kean / permanent replacement in the summer (plus a solution to the long term RB).,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Strong team , Allan back for Man Utd game , 3pts has to be a must against a poor Newcastle team , striker still needed by the end of monday , any injury to Calvert-Lewin could ruin a European spot !!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Believe Bernard, Tosun, and Lossil are all on their way out before Mondays deadline, hence the lack of options on the bench. Would have thought any spaces could be filled by some of the U23's for the experience?",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Attacking lineup today, not a lot of pace but a lot of creativity. COYB üí™",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"We've just played one of the poor teams in the league and they made us look like a bang average team. On Newcastles first goal we had all eleven players in the box. Their best player is left unmarked and not a single player near either posts. Overall a really bad performance
If we keep playing in such a negative manner we've no chance of European football.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Knew he'd select Pickford. Hope he doesn't live too regret this. Not happy.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Not sure what Pickford has to do to get dropped but like the rest of it, although holgate and Godfrey unlucky right decision we need full backs who will get forward and create chances, dcl will benefit",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"He keeps experimenting with the midfield. Keeps getting caught out too. Godfrey, Holgate and Gomes unlucky to miss out. Richy lucky to keep his place.
This will either work and we will score 4 or 5 or we could end up being embarrassed.
Lucky that Carlo is the expert and hope he has got it right.
COYB.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Dont mattter what team you play, ref was awfull, James get grabbed by the neck by shelvy and pulled over, it was a perfessional foul around 15th minute shoud have been a yellow. The ref then allows another 5 tackles each one on James before given a yellow card, yet carded 3 Everton players on their first foul. That changed the match. We didnt play great, but then when your play maker is taken down 3 times by the same person and 5 times in the first half, what can you do.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
So he drops our best player in Godfrey n keeps the clown in goal god sake carlo let's hope this is not another defeat,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Strong line up, good to have Doucoure back but we do need a striker, another threat...we‚Äôre very predictable. Should be 3pt COYB üíô",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Newcastle have played the same formation all season, 9-0-1. Now they've decided to change it up against us. Missed the first 15mins, but it's looking like a bit of a struggle. We need this win, those games in hand will be harder than this.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Need a much improved performance from the Leicester game. If Pickford has another shocker he needs to be dropped. Delph is back in training but pity he won‚Äôt be in any shape to be sold by Monday. COYB,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
I get Godfrey not playing hopefully this is just a rest for the lad. Pickford. Mmmm always looses his head against Newcastle.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Considering its supposed to be an attacking line up we haven't done much attacking, Iwobi and Richarlison both shite, haven't seen them go past their man or put a decent cross in yet, no wonder DCL is frustrated, playing one of the worse teams in the league and making them look good, absolute tripe.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Some people are never happy.. after the valuable point against title contenders Leicester all we need is a win today to shut some mouths our season is still good,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"That team should be more than good enough to beat Newcastle,good to make some changes as we have 3 big games in the next 12 days so good to make use of the squad but no excuses today,Newcastle
are poor so let‚Äôs show them what we have",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Very weird to see Godfrey on bench, probably just resting. In Carlo we trust, COYB!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
We are lazy. No pace. I saw the stat of most distance covered and 4 out of 5 players were Newcastle. Why? Why? Why? Are the players told not to run? Or is it they just can‚Äôt be arsed?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"No clue y Carlo has 2 GKs on bench, Richie needs to layoff his ""Neymaresque plays"" n for his thing..Need the 3 points today, no excuses...COYBs",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Strong team. Coleman and Gylfi being brought in shows intent to attack. Godfrey just being rested. 3-0 everton COYB!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Awful performance, not enough creativity, and key player are poor. We need quality additions and get rid of overpaid players like Gylfi. Golden chances missed yet again, Everton that!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Harsh on Godfrey but a rest will do him good plus he has played more games than he expected to this season.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"I‚Äôm sure Carlo has some psychological masterplan with two keepers, but squad clearly lacking attacking depth. Hopefully a surprise before Monday please!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
you will never win a game when you have a throw in 3/4 up the pitch and the ball finds its way back to the goalie!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Looks like Godfrey is going to have to turn in to a right back to get a game. Good team but 2 GKs and 3 defenders on the bench shows how short the squad is,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"We don't have a hope in hell of getting into Europe playing football like that. We are crying out for a wide player with pace. We are too slow all over the park
Sorry Carlo but that just isn't good enough for us. I hope there is a player or two lined up otherwise it's about 7th or 8th at the end of the season.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
I we played Godfrey and Holgate and Digne in midfield we don't lose that.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Godfrey? Been our best player for weeks!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Thought this would be line up, only contentious one is Godfrey, he has been a revelation, that team is gonna win today COYB",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Sadly you knew Newcastle were gonna score....and we‚Äôre not going to reply by the sound of it. I won‚Äôt be looking at the comments in 15 minutes....,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Everyone knocking the team selection. Cmon He's obviously decided for more attacking play with the two wing backs bringing Coleman back in, pushing the ball forward then moving Rodriguez into the middle of the park Need to get some crosses into the box and we could be looking at a big win",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
I think the only thing that could let that team down is Pickford. Let‚Äôs hope not,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"lack of intensity, look more for the opposing goal if they want to qualify a cup, how is it possible that the forwards cover the goalscorer of the opposing team",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Yeah glad pickford is in goal got both teams to score Everton win ofcourse and with butter fingers in goal could come in,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"No striker on the bench. Dont worry, no doubt in my mind Godfrey could come on and do a good job as centre forward.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"Sitting here with a beer, nervously anticipating Pickford chucking another one in.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Can't believe Godfrey is not playing..,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2

"Would love to see Godfrey at lb and Digne ahead of him .
Would give great balance to the team",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Pickford gets wound up easily playing Newcastle probably should have rested him today,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Pickford needs to shine today. This could be last chance saloon for the keeper,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
"We were like a blunt knife, that couldn't even cut threw some melted butter, no attacking threat what so ever... We should try and sell sigurson by Monday, utter garbage on 120k a week...",205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Very surprised Godfrey on bench he‚Äôs been outstanding,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
What a surprise.. slack off & let Newcastle grow in confidence.. üôÑ,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
I know said we not signing anyone but surely we need a striker not one on bench and take it tosun and Bernard off,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Thought Carlo would have picked Olsen in goal but how many more chances will Pickford get until he gets dropped to the bench? Pickford does seem to try and pull off Hollywood style saves but he's still adept at making mistakes every other game,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
Pickford was always going to play as thats a managers way of saying he backs him. I bet pickford is rated next game,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2
So lossl goes and we still put 2 keepers on the bench?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Home,-2

Come on leeds I've always kept the faith!!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
See how it goes... I really hope Pablo gets a look in tonight. I really think he can unlock the opposition as good as any player in that league.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Being a Geordie and a Leeds fan since 1972 this is ferkin amazing result.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
The W looks very pretty in this column for sure. I think we played well after conceding the first goal.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Wow great 4th and 5th goals hope the leeds have used up the weekly goal quota for sunday,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Bielsa knows best but personally was looking for him to freshen it up a bit more, Poveda in for Harrison, leif left back, Strujik CB add some height to set pieces",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Good to see Costa nowhere near after that last game. Shambles of a performance.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Good to see Pablo back in the mix. Would love to see him come on and make an impact late on. Think that‚Äôs going to be his role!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"No Idea how Harrison is starting again after the three last games? Would have started PH and leif davis needs to change the team, hopefully wrong MOT",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Don't get a result tonight, then its back to drawing board. Simply gotta win these homes games against the teams in and around us.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Embarrassing some of the comments here that we've lost already.
Just need to start picking up points again enough to stay up.

Why don't some of you pi** off to support another team?
Half of you actually even been to Elland Road?

How's about the fact that we might actually NOT lose?
And even if we do, ALAW",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"I hope Cooper is on his game, I don't feel easy and don't relax when he's playing, you don't know if he turns up or not. Mot",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Notice Costa didn't even make the bench. Thought he was absolutely dreadful when he came on against WHU.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Thought struijk might have gotten a start for abit of protection at set piece play,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Much as I love Bielsa, it does seem that you can have a really poor game week after week, as Harrison has, and still be apparently indispensable. Costa not even made the bench?",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"So thankful this isn‚Äôt on sky sports tonight don‚Äôt think I could bring myself to watch and be frustrated by it.

Kilch and Bamford in the starting line up again.

Points dropped again",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Same team same formation same style of play no matter the results it‚Äôs so predictable... going to be a loooong season,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Come on boys, need 3 points today! In you we believe,",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"I have faith.

For me, Klich needs resting or at least one or two games off to realise that he‚Äôs not playing well and maybe that will give him the kick he needs. Not good enough at the minute for Leeds.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
My hubby is a Geordie - need us to smash em tonight! üëäüèº,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Struik should be in the team
Same team that lost last time out!!",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Big game Sunday may make changes for that game but tonight is an important 6 pointer come you whites #mot,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Good job he didn‚Äôt announce this in the presser to keep all these shocks and surprises up his sleeve!! üôÑ,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
I‚Äôd have played struik and Cooper as centre halves so ayling could get forward more the rest he really hasn‚Äôt much option to select my only gripe is weres the kids that r smashing up the under23s league surely there worth a bench at least mot,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"How are other players expected to get a game if players that haven't been performing are still getting picked? It makes no sense! It doesn't encourage players to pick up there game as they will just think they are doing enough to stay in the team.

I have no problems with how Bielsa wants us to play it's up to the players to put the performance in he can't help in that situation. But he does need to start being more ruthless with players.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
I bet Newcastle have spent all week trying to guess what team he would put out.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
If we dont get something tonight questions meed to be asked about playing out of form players persistently. Has to be disheartening to be a squad player for leeds knowing ur never getting in team barring injuries,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Atleast Newcastle aren't as much of an aerial threat I suppose. Good luck lads,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Only ever worked in championship cos the man was an unknown entity, so many games in to season, was bound to get found out, cos can only play 1 way . . Guna be a long old un this year!! Cooper, alioski, dallas, roberts defo struggling in this league!!",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Maggies getting beat tonight.
Leeds 2 for joy, Mags 1 for sorrow.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Harrison and Alioski down the left worry me. Big games needed for both tonight. Having said that, in Bielsa we trust.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Would have liked to have seen some changes for a bit more height at the back, just hope we've learned from our mistakes, come on Leeds",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"This 11 frustrates me, Harrison, Alioski, Klich have been complete drivel the last few games.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be saying this so early into the season but I think it‚Äôs a 6 pointer today. Got to keep the daylight between the bottom 4/5 teams and us.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
I was hoping the new xbox and ps5 would keep fifa mangers busy and off posts on here,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"I'm glad costa has been dropped, I get we ain't the best around but no excuse for how he played against westham. Please get Hernandez back in from the bench and not tyler Robert's üôÑ",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
For Harrison's sake I really hope he can perform today. He doesn't deserve to start based on his last few performances,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Got to trust Bielsa but huge improvement needed. Hope it works out, he‚Äôll get pelters if we play as bad defensively as the last game.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Wish he would change it a bit Harrison and aloski don‚Äôt work together klich is knackered can‚Äôt pass or shoot at the moment and no height again in defence put ayling rb and put struijk in defence he has the height. So watch the needles corners and free kicks given again and panick in defence,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Pascal should be playing need strength in defence but looks a good bench and I think they will be called on,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Does this mean ayling wont be doing his runs again missed it against w ham.or well I suppose bielsa gets the dosh to run the team let's hope for 3 pts ALAW,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Harrison and Cooper need to preform today they are shocking so far this season,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Let‚Äôs hope we don‚Äôt concede any corners! Set plays a huge Achilles heel, cannot score from them and can‚Äôt defend them. Problem ever since Pontus left, needs addressing in Jan as constantly costing us points. Newcastle‚Äôs only chance tonight is set plays, surely Struk is worth a go? He at least gives us some height.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Why won't he give Joe Gerhalt a go??

He's smashing up the under 23's",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Erm....is that not just the same team again??? Let‚Äôs hope Harrison and Klich wake up a bit today!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
The same team that was shocking Friday lol,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Personally would have played Struijk and kept Ayling at full back.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Not too bad hope brings on Pablo if needed,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
The definition of madness is doing the same thing and expecting a different result!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
We need some Pablo magic!!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Don't know why Bielsa keeps playing Allioski and Harrison although they were playing badly last couple of games. Am indeed very worried tonight,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Need to be 2 nil up before they bring Andy Carroll on,he‚Äôll cause mayhem to our Cooper led defence!",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Come on lads you can do it we will all be watching and with you in spirit ALAW,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Possibly a more traditional 4-2-3-1?

Might stop teams getting a free run through the heart of our team when we lose the ball",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
No Costa which is a good move.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Bielsa says he doesn't think any player deserved to be replaced from the last performance think he needs to go to spec savers,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Wonder if we'll play three at the back with ayling Cooper Phillips, with klich in Phillips normal role.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
No Costa? I saw bielsa shouting at him multiple times in the last game and figured he was in for some wrath....,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
How has Harrison kept his place ? He needs resting,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
I'd have put strujik at the back with Cooper we need height at the back bielsa will use Roberts at some point,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Would liked to have seen Greenwood on the bench, maybe given 15 mins",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Alioski and Harrison really lucky to keep their place in the starting eleven.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"The team im not sure ive been a leeds man since the 70,s would like to ask my fellow leeds men and women how do yas feel",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Harrison due a big game and Rodrigo due a goal.. Hopefully today!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
COME ON LEEDS!üíôüíô,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Come on Leeds you can do it üôåüèæüí™üèæüôèüèæ,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Where was Costa tonight?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Klich isn't good. Poveda needs to start. Bielsa needs to buy a true CAM or else they are going to get relegated.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
I‚Äôve only just seen the highlights from the West Ham game and in looked to me like Ayling wasn‚Äôt with it. No one else seems to be mentioning it though??,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Come on Leeds üòéüòé,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Surprised Harrison is starting after his recent performances.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
How many crosses will make it into the box and how many will a Leeds player get to?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Come on leeds!!!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Time for players to earn their place rodrigo Harrison need to start getting on the scoreboard big game tonight MOT.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Any tips on watching the match in the US?? New fan here #LUFC,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"What has Harrison ever done for Leeds? Does he go past his man? Does he dribble or weave? Win free kicks? Put in brilliant crosses? What has Harrison ever done for us??

Oh, great goal Rodrigo
Thanks Harrison üôÇ",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
After seeing this I‚Äôm tempted to back Newcastle at 3/1 cos this team looked so unorganised and tired against West Ham üôà,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Like to see him mix it up abit . But in bielsa we trust come on Leeds,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"Both teams have a dedicated fan base from cultures
which appreciate their football and their respective communities. Listening to commentary on Amazon prime and not the drivel churned out by ...???
Hope Harrison realises U23s are after his job,",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Whatever Hernandez did to Bielsa need to be known..,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Costa injury or just not making the bench?,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"At least will see poveda if Harrison dunt perform tonight and not costa
Come on boys MOT",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
I wander what players ratings will be today in papersü§£ü§£,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
I knew you could do it leeds,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Two assists for El Mago when he did come on! 5 bloody 2!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Lets do this. 3 points tonight!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Come on leeds!!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Let‚Äôs just hope they don‚Äôt get any corners!! ü§∑,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Same team as last week I see another poor performance. I could see us losing this game in the first half. Hope i am wrong tho.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Same old same old if they don't perform tonight people are going to go nuts,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Pascal should be playing Harrison been playing bad know couple of matches never dropped,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
It‚Äôs a battle it‚Äôs the guy who is willing to die on the battle field who is gonna win the final run.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Is Costa‚Äôs injured??,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
"I‚Äôm sure a lot of players will give better performances tonight, surely ü§îüëç",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3
Bamford running where ball not and klich carrying on from last game need to take control in there box üòîüíôüíõ,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Home,3

"An emphatic first-half Patrick Bamford penalty earned Leeds United an important three points at Elland road this afternoon helping the Whites move up to eleventh in the Premier League table against an in form Burnley side; previously unbeaten in their last four games.

Leeds managed to hang on despite a nail biting finale which saw Burnley threaten to nick something late on with chances from substitute Jay Rodriguez, who fired over from close range and then Illan Meslier keeping out a Ashley Barnes's effort at his near post.

In all honesty Bielsa's side should really have had the game done and dusted by the end of the first half with the amount of chances they created in a game they started exceptionally well, showing an enormous improvement from the way they started in last weekend's disastrous defeat away at Old Trafford.

Despite their current make shift defence, which has been forced upon them due to the amount of defensive injury's they have at the moment, Leeds looked creative and assured on the ball from the off and it took just three minutes for the home side to take the lead much to the relief of their fans at home watching.

In very unlike Bielsa fashion, Luke Ayling played a long ball over the top leaving the Burnley defence for dead, putting Bamford straight in on goal before being clattered by the on coming Nick Pope, resulting in the referee Robert Jones pointing to the spot.

Bamford confidently stepped up and smashed the ball in to the top right corner of the net leaving the Burnley keeper with no chance, one can only imagine the noise of Elland road had the fans been present .

The home side nearly extended their lead straight away with some fine attacking football from the lively Brazilian Raphinha who slid the ball through to Alioski who only had to square the ball to one of his team mates in the box but the Macedonian international failed to find any one with his cross, instead firing high and wide into an empty stand.

Leeds continued to dominate the possession in the first half with Burnley struggling to cope with their high press and energetic style.

They very nearly added a second when Raphinha pounced on some lack lustre Burnley defending, teeing the ball up nicely for Jack Harrison, who really just had to compose himself and place his shot in to one of the corners but he failed to do so, hitting his shot straight at the Burnley keeper from about six yards out.

It's those types of missed chances that will frustrate the Leeds fans because they know their side need to be a lot more clinical at this level and if that chance goes in they could have then go in at the break with a two nil cushion.

Despite their first-half dominance there were a few scares for the West Yorkshire side, I don't think many Leeds fans would disagree with me if I said they had their hearts in their mouths every time their side conceded a set piece or corner during the match.

Meslier will probably have counted himself a touch fortunate when the referee sided with him and awarded a free kick rather then let Ashley Barnes goal stand, a decision the away fans may have felt a bit aggrieved by.

England midfielder Kalvin Phillips played superbly in his new sweeper role today, dropping in deep between Ayling and Struijk, dealing with absolutely everything that came his way as did Patrick Bamford up top, proving to be a real handful for the Burnley centre backs.

Luke Ayling and Stuart Dallas continued to prove their Premier league stature and once again showed just how important their versatility is for Marcelo Bielsa's team.

In the second-half Burnley looked a totally different team and pressured the home side for the first fifteen minutes after break, surprisingly even dominating the possession as they unsuccessfully searched for a equaliser.

Bielsa made some good changes, bringing on both Pablo Hernandez and Ian Poveda, two players both very good in possession and at retaining the ball at a time when Burnley were dominating the play.

Academy graduate Jamie Shakleton also offered some fresh legs in the later stages replacing a tired looking and low in confidence Mateusz Klich.

After such an impressive start to the season the Polish international looks like he could do with a rest and would perhaps be grateful if his manager brought in another midfielder or two to provide cover for him as the season goes on.

As the game went on there was one last opportunity for Leeds to grab a second goal when their little Spanish magician Hernandez found himself in a 4 v 2 scenario on the edge of the Burnley box after a quick break from a corner but his shot just lacked the finesse it needed to find its way into the bottom right corner.

If he had converted the chance it would of eased the nerves of the fans in the nail biting dying moments of the game and put the icing on the cake on a important result for the team considering the amount of first team players out of action in what is already a very thin squad in comparison to most other teams in the league.

Marcelo Bielsa deserves a huge amount of credit for the job he is doing and for where Leeds United are currently placed in the league at this stage in the season going in to the new year.

Todays win will be crucial for Leeds going forward and I'm sure their fans will have been over moon watching Kalvin Phillips and Luke Ayling keep former striker Chris Wood in their back pockets all afternoon on a day the Australian international and former left-back Charlie Taylor returned to Elland road.",144,Leeds,Burnley,Home,1

Seriously 2 weeks without a game and then more injuries someone really needs to have a look at what's going on in training too many players are getting injured,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
10 minutes of utter boredom. Absolutely not worth watching. Liverpool players can go on holidays right now. They‚Äôve earned it this season.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
True I agree too much training in before the games. We have no clue how to chase or stop them. we are lucky to be were we are. No energy lazy tired players need a change diffidently to top up compared to top 3 clubs.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Lets go Liverpool! Best team ever and inspirational! ‚ù§üôå,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Hello Reds, and hello Mr. Klopp...
Oh today there is a big chance to come back into the race, teams around Liverpool dropping points.
Great line-up, so good luck for the guys and Mr. Klopp - sure you want to make us happy and proud - and all the best for Mr. van Dijk and for the fantastic fans of LFC.
Heja BVB...",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I don't like the defence we are having its more of gambling at a time when we are about to miss a champions league slot. At least kabak would help instead of R. Williams who many times forgets to defend n becomes a striker,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"With Chelsea having beaten Man City, our slim hopes of salvaging the season are over. Our season is a failure. No Champions League next season. No trophy of any kind. We messed our season with 6 straight home defeats. We were never going to recover from this. Our remaining games are practically meaningless.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Ben Davies will not play at all. All of these injuries when he has not played at all and he was always available for Preston NE. Club just looking for a quick profit in the transfer market this summer.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Great to see such an attacking line up at Anfield in a must win game... NOT!!!!

Three boring non assisting midfielders again, which will leave the three up front isolated, again!

.. Ox, Shaq and Bobby on the bench. I guess Klopp thinks the formation that has got us only 54 points so far is a great formation :( Has he gone mad?? 4.3.3 again *sigh.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Davies injured or just not used, whats the point of buying him? Kabak injured too?? I think someone's not doing a proper job at LFC in training. Why all our players getting frequently injured?? Williams and Philips combination doesn't sound that reliable",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Oh ffs what are we doing in training ? At this stage of the season with fk all to play for it shouldn‚Äôt be intense training. The same names injured again.. something needs to change big time. Fkn sick of this season,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Wijnaldum is overrated. He has nothing to contribute in that midfield. Firmino should replace him. Wijnaldum can come in when we are winning. Milner, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Thiago and Fabinho play the same pattern. Among them, Fabinho is the best in that role. Wijnaldum is not a creative midfielder. He's a holding midfielder that prefers to play the ball back and sideways.

#YNWA",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
A little concerned about Williams he lacks pace and ability for this level,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Phillips and Williams starting at CB? üòÇü§£ We have a solid opportunity to go out there & hand the match to Southampton as a gift. This Liverpool defense is the worst since the Rodgers era.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Not a bad line up, but would of put the OX or Shaqiri in, instead of Gini .YNWA",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Something lacking in this line up... not much on the bench maybe
Hope we win, though Chelsea's win at Man City makes my dream of top 4 very distant now
I've been hoping all of 2021, and nada
YNWA",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
We have 5 games! We have to win all 5. Let‚Äôs hope today we start with 1st win ..,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Our bench is again so poor, really hope Harvey Elliot is in the first team next season!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I worry about the severe lack of pace in our 2 centre halves üôÑ,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Today you must give us victory at anfield ,we are fed up with draws , I also want to believe that Virgil is preserved for the new season otherwise we miss him so much",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"An enquiry must be open about our players injuries.
No other team in PL is enduring the same fate.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
How can 4 players get injured without even having a gameüôÑ,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Too many injuries this season, the medical staff should be under evaluation!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Minor fitness concerns. What the heck are we saving them for?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I‚Äôm very Surprised with Keita been injured he‚Äôs never injured,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Need a good game from our midfield and full backs... The centre backs are relatively inexperienced and need some protection,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"That starting 11 and bench,we look like an average team.need to get players back from injury and buy some quality in.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I honestly think they want to lose R Williams in the back and Gini still gets game even that he is leaving. No proper depth in this team.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Would av started Bobby instead of Jota, Jota looks better when he comes from the bench. Most of the game he starts end badly. Shaq should av started instead of Gini.
Would gone for a 4-2-3-1 formation.
Chosen back four, 2; Thiago & fabinho, 3; salah , mane, Shaq then firmino on top. My suggestion though. Put in klopp we trust. #ynwa_liverpool_",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"I know Klopp said Nabys future is at Liverpool, but come on. We have to sell this guy, he's been Klopps biggest flop at the club. 50+million for what?",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why are we still starting Gini ? He‚Äôs leaving let‚Äôs start planing for life after him! Ox shax kieta Jones should all get a chance,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I would rather my 60 year old dad with zero football skills played centre back than have Williams,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
We bought Ben Davies because ?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Good to have Fabinho in midfield, helping out both the defence & controlling the midfield!

Attack wins u games but defence wins u titles!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Rhys Williams can't defend to save his life. He is slow and always out of position,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Keita again on the treatment table.......at this stage I think its getting ridiculous.....
.he is an injury prone liability and should be one of the first to be sold or released this summer",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
3 seasons with fitness concerns for KeitaüòÇ,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Y do we keep playin winaldum an makin him captain is a kick in the teeth safer playin players who want to b ther,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Williams is concerning... But, glad to see Fab staying in midfield and not at CB... Obviously need the 3points today!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Wijnaldum is a big joke
Can‚Äôt wait for the next season",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Woodburn:D just seeing his named included is great,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I think keita is now turning into a liability .better we sell him,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Nothing less than three points tonight. The reds have to win every game now to stand a chance of top four. Chelsea's result didn't help but we have to go for it.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Another different CB pairing which again makes us vulnerable but glad to see Fabinho back in midfield as he makes a massive difference in how we play when he‚Äôs there.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I don't understand how Ben Davies hasn't had a game I've heard he's decent just want him to play a few games to have a look can't even make bench,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams start for Liverpool.

Ozan Kabak, James Milner, Naby Keita and Ben Davies are ruled out due to minor injury concerns.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Let the B team played rest of the season. No way absolutely no chance for top 4. So Let the B team take it from there. Sad üò¢ next year we‚Äôll be playing Thursdays instead of Tuesday and Wednesday.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why do we keep using gini? He is leaving by the end of the season so why would he play his heart out by risking injury?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Still a strong line up especially with fab back in midfield,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Kabak? This is season we just so unlucky and klopp selection sometimes cost us,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Oh no. Oh no another slow midfield and jeepers wijnaldum again !!! Hes useless and too slow. He can't tackle and never puts a thru ball . Never gets injured cos he can't tackle and gets rid of the ball sideways or backwards- what klopp sees in him I'll never know and he wants to go so why keep playing him - give ox, keita or shaq a chance, but klopp loves gini too much. Totally baffled !!!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I think this is the 23 different partnership defenders....,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why the F##K is gini playing. Naby should be starting. Sorry klopp got it wrong again. YNWA,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"We need to buy players
Our subs doesn't just cut it

A big game tho
Let's fight for the 3 points",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Keita has a minor fitness concern? How did that happen?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"If Klopp never gives playing time..to subs when he needs them they do not perform.
Firmino should be playing today
YNWA",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
If we are not 3-0 by halftime then it's going to be a long slog for us. If it's 0-0 at 70 minutes then we could lose 1-0 or draw 0-0. We struggle against the teams in the relegation zone.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"We've got two unexpected gifts, from foxes & spurs. They should be used in full measure. Head On,Reds & YNWA!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
The time for Gerrard seems to be close. Klopp's bad signings continues to worsen the team.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Tiago not suited 4 epl we should let him go play ox or.they must.get someone who can cause a goalscoring threat,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Chelsea win against city could even be a blessing in disguise, leichester still have to play united, Chelsea and Spurs, fourth place still for grabs",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
No Davies again. Poor lad. Feel he‚Äôs been harshly treated. Deserves a chance.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why is Wijnaldum still playing? Why not rest some players here and there to see if you have any quality for next season because this season showed just how much we lack in depth?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Whoever the fitness coach is at Liverpool needs to be fired.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Come on lads... Chelsea just beat City, now make our day!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Another week another injury, are they training for wrestling match or football match.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Good line up. Good to see midfielders in midfield and defenders defending. Firmino on the bench is a good move too. üëç 3 - 0 to the reds.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
That's what happens when we play defenders in defensive roles,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Wat happened to kabak coz Rys has no pace,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Apart from the Chelsea game, results have gone our way! Boys prove to us that you‚Äôve been working on your finishing, and get the win!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Salah and Man√© are only interested in who is on top of goals player stats. They are not playing for the team. I think klopp should study Bayern M√ºnchen.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Ke√Øta injured again? What happened this time?

Just asking.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Of course keita is out with a fitness concern...... the guy is a walking, talking fitness concern",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"We still have our destiny in our hands.Teams dropping points around us and we really need to use that to our advantage.We‚Äôve
rested for two weeks and there shouldn‚Äôt be any excuse#UPTHERED
S#YNWA",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Davies must be injured ?? Surely worth spot on bench ahead of Billy or even a start ahead of Williams,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Another loss just give up on this season and next will be the same unless klopp goes,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Where the heck is Ben Davies the lad who's being sign to fill the CB position... Why waste money when he's not going play,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why do we keep starting gini when all he‚Äôs talked about is leaving try bobby midfield,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Gini starting again??? Just cant understand why playing a midfielder who slows down the attack if the goal is to go for 3 points,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Good luck lads...but why is shakiri still on the bench atleast, yep we really need to rebuild...even on the bench jones is the most like one to do something",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
All this names are no longer a threat to anybody anymore . Change of names are needed next season.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
I wonder how players do not play and get injured. What about keita. Always injured and klopp says he has a future at the club,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Bench is very poor how have they all got injured we not played in over 13 days ü§¨,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
This fan has fitness concerns about Davies and Keita that are considerably more than 'minor'üò°,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Man city deliberately losing.... And even if Leicester go fifth, West ham look good too... Sigh",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"For those who have been complaining about klopp's team selection, what do you have to say now?",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why did we buy Davies? Was it Klopp's choice? Don't think so.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Does Ben Davies actually exist? Is he even a person let alone a footballer?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Playing with fire again , still haven‚Äôt learn learn lessons of letting in late goals while defending 1 goal",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Very well done to Liverpool. Let's end the season on a winning note and enjoy playing with each other. DON'T worry about Chelsea or any other team. We just do what we can. We atleast deserve to play champions league next season no matter what place we finish. It's a been a tough situation for all with covid messing everything up. But we keep going. #YNWA #LFC #TRUSTINKLOPP,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why we playing Rhys is kanaka is injured and where Gini today,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
5 games 5 wins needed anything else no UCL,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Defence is oh so shaky. Midfield sluggish, but the wingers are playing well. Better finish needed, again.
Come on lads.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Should have started Woodburn in wijnaldum's place he don't deserve a place in the LFC side since he is leaving at the end of the season,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Finally Klopps puts Jota in Firmino's position, no offense Bobby is awesome but I know Jota will score today",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"I take it Ben Davis was a bluff/
decoy purchase to silence most fans who were concerned about our defensive fragilities???? ü§î",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Gini is picked again? As Captain? Absurd. That guy has no impact going forward or bring in any creativity to the team. Can't see this lineup beating Southampton.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Where is Kabak? Why didn't Klopp play natural centrebacks against Leeds and Newcastle when he could? Can anyone tell me what is wrong with this club?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
When will shaqiri get a chance to start the game?What wrong has he ever done?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Am concerned with Williams but still hope Phillips will cover up otherwise good line up,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"In a whole season when Kaita is fit?
Please get rid of him!",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"I don't know what klupp thinks about Keita, if you don't want to use him, let him to go an other teame. It's simple",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
The team is looking so weak lately first choice and bench doesnt look strong we need a proper number 9 a wini replacement and a adrian replacement asap and konate and another cb,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Not a bad line up let's see if we can get payback fir earlier in the seasonü§û,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
We need to overhaul this team... Keita and origi should be thrown away,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Davies out with minor fitness concerns.

Gini should have been replaced by Jones. The guy has no future at the team so why play someone who walk alone,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Welcome back Ben Woodburn. Youngest scorer for Liverpool, a product of the Melwood academy #YNWA",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"This team is not good enough to play the champions league, Liverpool need to buy players good one's and remove all this old guy's.",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Klopp must not rate Jones! you would think he would be trying to help and encourage him,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Sorry but that musialoski should be on the bench that kid play better than woodburn,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Whats the time for the match pls? The team are losing it this season who we offend ? ? ?,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Looking at the subs good to see Woodburn back üëç,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2

Nice to see Woodburn on the beach. Pretty solid starting XI as well.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
How the hell 4 players get injured and we didn‚Äôt even play for 2 weeks üòÇ,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
Why the he'll is Gini playing every week when he is leaving???,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
So is Ben Davies dead ??? Most pointless signing in our history no doubt,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
He's done what he should have done for months. Playing Fabinho CM even if means playing kids at the back,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2

Greenwood shouldn't start this game he recently can't find his place in the pitch...

Shaw's will get his angle broken for sure. Mahrez will love 1v1 duel. Fat so can't turn along with him. Ole needs to be sacked. He is biased on English and some big name players like Pogba where he can't bench them.,117,Man Utd,Man City,Home,0

Shelvey n Haydon in centre...... cant see too much exciting football coming from that. Ones defensive minded and other is lazy come on Bruce sort this out,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Bunch of moaners on here ! I think joelinton has done ok last few games. All the people bewildered Almiron is on the bench, the fella struggles with the final pass or shot, yes he is a good team player granted but we don‚Äôt need to play him every game.. maybe Bruce is thinking this will be a physical game so has gone for the bigger player ? What do I know... Joseph Tinsley-Black awaits witty response....",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Think Murphy should have started and big joe should start with Wilson they need to start and develop a partnership Will be surprised if st max sees 60 mins never trained all week come on the toon,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Miggy is one of our most hardworking players and keeps being put on the bench. The end is near... I can see Miggy leaving soon. Let's see how many shots we have on target today. üéØüéØüòï,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Okey.. We have a okey lineup, but with Bruce to tell them how to play we are f*****. We have no plan. Doesnt want to play football. No movement. Fan from Norway, and every player in Norway runs more then newcastle players does.. i dont understand how they can not run. Bruce?",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
I don‚Äôt understand how Joelinton and Hendrick get a start ahead of Almiron. One of the more creative players we have. They better win this one. I‚Äôd take 1:0 right this second.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Don't agree with some of the choices made in the squad but guess in Bruce we trust for now at least.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"That‚Äôs not our strongest team at all.
Manquillo has been great recently
Miggy on the bench?
Hopefully I‚Äôm proven wrong as usual. Haha.",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

Kraft doesn‚Äôt cut it for me. Manquillo over him any day. When fraser‚Äôs up to full fitness put him n ASM wide with Wilson in the middle of a 433,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Just be happy to see some shots on target and chances created.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
ALMIRON on the bench again. The man hasn't a clue how to play an attack I g formation. He's never done it. But one thing he's good at and that's taken teams down,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Hendrick playing on the wing where he doesn't like playing and miggy on the bench... Hard working team player quick and a real threat on the wing oh brucey you nearly picked a good team for once,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

"Leeds have just drawn with man city, so with a win of 2 or more, the mighty toon army will go fifth..... Come on.",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Hope the manager and team just watched leeds game. Fantastic attacking football from both sides.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Everyone moaning about miggy being on the bench. I must be the only person who thinks he's useless. Yes his passion and his work rate are fantastic but his movement, passing and shooting are rubbish. I love the lads passion but as a footballer he's average at best",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Disappointed Almiron does not start, we need a big game from Shelvey tonight, he was very poor on Wednesday !!",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Bit of positivity anyone? Absolute drain reading 99% of these comments üôÑ,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
How can Emil Krath be getting into this starting 11. That‚Äôs beyond a joke he‚Äôs third choice right back in my eyes!!!,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Not feeling optimistic for this one... you have Almiron and Fraser who are arguably the quickest players to counter with (known how Bruce plays) and joelinton playing ahead of them wow üòÖ,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Leaving out either fraser or almairon for jolinton is a disgrace by the way.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Sorry but it‚Äôs not very often I criticise Bruce infact I like him as a manager. But no Almiron and manquillo who I‚Äôve thought has played pretty decent not playing is just asking for trouble! And he wonders why he gets criticised üôÑüôÑ,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
To me that looks like a 451 rather 442. Think Jolinton and ASM will both be wide.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Should be dropping shelvey not Miggy horrendous decision and no way should he have the armband with the shocking performances he's been putting in.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Why no start for Fraser yet again? I know he‚Äôs already played this week in the carabao cup but I‚Äôd pick him over Hendrick, just mind you.",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

think they have a lot to prove in todays game. so far we have seen flashes (very few) of great play but mostly we been shocking.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Just watching leeds attacking man city then will probably see us defending for 90 mins against bottom team Burnley reserves,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Almiron has been far more productive than joelinton! Yet on the bench Bruce doesn‚Äôt wanna attack teams,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
JoeLinton starting and front and center of the photo. Howay man! Sell him to Sunderland already!,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Nice attacking lineup. Would be happy with a 1-1 draw,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Decent, I still think shelvy should be dropped tho and play Hendrick cm and put almiron on behind Wilson, apart from the odd game and his passing now and again he just is to slow and lazy for cm in the prem dosent work hard enuff for the team.",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
He hasn‚Äôt got a clue this man he‚Äôs playing shelvey and all the players that get in behind are on the bench it‚Äôs guna be a case of playing a long ball and hoping something happens üòÇ,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

No Fraser or almiron!! I bet almiron is sick of it now. Arguably our best player towards the end of the season and also arguably are best player this season,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Why not Almiron and Fraser? We have potentially one of the quickest forward lines in the premier League and he doesn't want to play them...very annoying.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
The FMB and his team selection is an absolute joke bar saint maximum there is no pace or creativity in the midfield why isn‚Äôt either almiron or Fraser starting,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Hardest working player on the bench yet again let's hope he understands he's our super sub when we're 2 down with 5 mins left to play poor miggy deserves more,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

So we‚Äôre playing Hendrick on the wing again? Good. Good.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Hendrick cannot play on the wing, and we have 2 clear out and out wingers on the bench. Dont understand that choice myself but I'll I will give him until half time before I start really criticising üòÇ",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

Shelvey is probably the only one who has the quality (on his day) to stop them completely dominating in midfield.,157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Home,0
Bruce just doesn‚Äôt get it. These 9 at the back setups fail each and every time. Damaged limitations right from the off. No fans will criticise a defeat if there is some kind of attempt at attacking them but there just won‚Äôt be. Less than 20% of the ball first half gauranteed,157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Home,0
Ready for the toon too dominate possession... play free flowing attacking football and just completely dominate through the middle of the field... toon by 3+... it‚Äôs the last day of 2020 anything could happen.... but if we even get a point or manage to lose by less than 3 I‚Äôll take that as a win,157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Home,0

Under circumstances a reasonable line up but BRUCE the all shitey needs to let them have a go. I'd have had Gayle in instead of the awful Joelinton.

Very poor in last game so let‚Äôs just put out the same team apart from Fraser and Murphy how Shelvey still gets a game is beyond me and Hendricks isn‚Äôt even a championship player by what I have seen,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
A pretty pathetic line up clearly playing for a draw a point is no longer good enough at this stage we need a win we need three points! Burnley have overtaken us and Brighton are hot on our tail and they play Fulham should be playing 4-2-3-1 our best formation.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendricks on starting eleven. Is this real life? He must be very good at training since in games he is always bad. Dont know what brucey is watching.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

If that's the team I cant believe Lewis and Hendrick are in the team.thats like playing with 9 men.manquillo is on the bench and we have a winger at right back.even if he plays Murphy I would rather have Ritchie at left back instead of lewis.lewis is terrible.

"How Hendrick starts over Matty is beyond me

We should be playing 2 up front . Like Wilson ,Carroll . Or Wilson, Gayle.

---what for ???",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Wilson and Willock to make an impact off the bench (to replace ASM and Miggy maybe). See this as a big score game with leaky defences. But 3-2 to the Toon at FT. Just my 2 pennies.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
What‚Äôs willock done wrong to be put on the bench again? He‚Äôs a stand out performer for us.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1

"Would have had Carroll up top for the 1st hour then bring Wilson on not Joefuckinlinton
again FFS .. and willock instead of longstaff",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Cannot believe we have people saying Wilson should start. These are the same fans who would be slating Bruce for starting him if he pulls up after 60 mins with a recurring muscle injury.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Interesting comments regarding who should be playing centre forward. Not a mention of West Ham's former centre forward Andy Carrol who would be busting a gut to play against his old team.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Right team choice. Hope we grab some belief as west ham are shaky at the back. I can see us winning this one today but we need to watch out for their counter attack as they break so fast from the back.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
It would be Andy instead of Joelinton wouldn't even have him on the bench,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1

"Thought maybe a couple of the youngsters could‚Äôve at least been put on the bench. They may have got a short run out if we were sat comfortably. Then again... we are VERY rarely comfortable

Other than that, looks a good team",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"Just goes to show how far away the younger players must be if not one of them are included in the squad to play in what is effectively a dead rubber.
Or is it just a short sighted view of getting an extra million or 2 for finishing a couple of places higher?
Either way it wreaks of ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt have a long term strategy apart from staying up‚Äô",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
Great team but would rather Gayle over joelinton or put them together,367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"For all the talk of the youngsters and are so called decent academy, shame 3:4 don‚Äôt get the bench with a potential chance to shine and Jeff Hendricks does??? Awful",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
Surely Anderson should be getting some time in the squad at least. No better time for him to get game time than against bottom of the league when we're already safe.,367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"Short sighted not to have a couple of young guys on the bench, at least. We are safe and therefore have nothing to lose so if we could throw a young player or two on with 20 minutes to go in a winnable game it would have been beneficial to them",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"Love how you some of us are still slagging Joelinton off - he‚Äôs got 3 in his last 5 starts. Yes, his overall record is poor. I‚Äôm not saying his recent form deserves any praise in the grand scheme of things but honestly some of the bashing on here is ridiculous üôÑü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1

"honestly, it took me sometime to believe when I read the first half statistics. something like 12 shoots, 66% procession, 200+ passes. Maybe 8 to 10 matches ago, all I asked was a proper football match from Newcastle. Not survival, not dominant performance but simply a proper football game with defence and attack, passing and dribbling, anything with basic football skills and teamworks. It was really bad, and it makes the recent display unbelievable. I knew, by watching these two teams over two seasons, things can go from bad to worst out of the blue. But lets hope for the better with the spirits inside these bunch of players.",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1

Lundstram doesn't even deserve a shirt. one lucky player that fans aren't allowed in the ground. No effort whatsoever cant pass a ball cant cross a ball. Terminate his contract an show him door,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
What‚Äôs happened to Moussett???,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
I dont get this mcburnie and mcgoldrick when there's brewster and Burke i can see another loss today,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
They figured us out towards the end of last season yet we still play the same. After a great few seasons wilder is out of ideas now. Bring in Rafa while we can early enough to try and save this season. Thankyou to all you've done wilder but time to go,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Said it all season, time to change formation, before it‚Äôs too late",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"WOW !
So many opinions and options from 1 - 11.
Wilder will find the right team, hopefully sooner rather than later.
Oh dear West Ham goal.
Now let‚Äôs see Burke and Brewster on",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Playing with 10 men ain't going to win anything even 10men and one donkey still won't win what does wilder see in him be glad when there both gone,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"I would have gone Robinson at back, ampadu in lowes position",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
I wish god aka Chris Wilder would scrap McBurnie he couldn‚Äôt score in a brothel with a months pay cheque,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Why does he keep playing max Lowe. He‚Äôs useless. Get Osborn in for him,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Not really much change once again. Glad Fleck is back and always liked Ampadu. McBurnie still playing I see üò£,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
No pace upfront will only invite West Ham to press us high up the pitch,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Where is enda?,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Is stevens injured?,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Glad he is trying Amp at left CF. Cmon boys get that drive and energy back. Believe!,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Ladies and Gentlemen The forged in steel, in your face, high tempo, fook you performance is coming today at 2pm.
3-0 blades. With a commanding performance from Egan, Norwood, Fleck and Berge.
You can thank me later
Nuff said. I‚Äôll fetch me coat",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Come on blades, 3 points today please!!!",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Is mcburnie wanking wilder off or sumut the lad dunt deserve to start yet again,i would of put mcgoldrick and burke upfront rest is spot on",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"I don‚Äôt agree with dropping Brewster, apart from the 1 on 1 which was offside anyway, he‚Äôs hardly Been given any opportunities, and with the midfield we have today I thought it would be a good opportunity for him",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Where to start? .... just put a proper shift in and look like a CWAK Blades side we recognise.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Wilder's obsession with playing McBurnie will be his downfall. He's spent ¬£20m on McBurnie and that's not working so give the other ¬£20m striker Brewster a run.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Would have preferred burke with is pace,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Why mcburnie.....Bu
rke is much quicker and more skillfull .....üò©",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Not sure about Lowe , he cost us last game , would like to see Burke up top",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
McBurnie üò§ where‚Äôs Sharp ?,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Osborne in for Lowe and sharp up with mcburnie for me... didzy to come off bench,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Looks a good team on paper, but I would like to see Brewster in place of McGoldrick.
The main point is that this is a Team Sport and we need the whole team playing together.
In Chris Wilder we trust.
He‚Äôs been through this as a player for the Blades.
He saw it as a fan.
If he can‚Äôt take the whole club with him no one can.
COYRAWWS",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Glad to see fleck back in the middle but my opinion should be starting with burke up top. Looked the most threat with his pace and power.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
You'll be facing Tony Pulis next season away. Would you fancy the derby?,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Feel abit for Brewster 3 1st starts against liverpool,City and Chelsea but glad to see Lundstrum on bench and Fleck back in ü§ûü§ûü§ûü§ûü§ûü§û",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Why do we stick with Mcburnie when we have Brewster,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"I would av played Burke alongside Brewster, an drop Didzy into midfield instead of Oli Nogood!! But hope I‚Äôm proved wrong an they get us the 3 points we so desperately need",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Not much threat up front there. Where the goals coming from? Don‚Äôt get that selection, what do I know though. Trust CW.",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Great to see Flecky back but would‚Äôve put Billy on the bench.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
What a strike force ! Two young hopefuls on the bench. If he brings Lundstram on l am switching off.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
When is Bogle going to get a chance Burke needs a chance also no goals in todays starters up front,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Why you change the Captain from norwood to EGAN ????!!!,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Probably would have given Burke a start he‚Äôs a handful, seems a bit of a reassuring sight seeing fleck back in the squad. Be better when mousset is starting 11 too",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Stevens out and where's Billy?,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
is stevens injured?,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
No goals in that team again no speed up front,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Good line up. Prefer Billy to Wantaway Lundstrum on the bench though.,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
Mcburnie why???,88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1
"Fleck is back

"Finally Chris realised that Lundstram and Brewster are not gonna win us games. Lunny is a flop who had a decent half-season and everyone lost their minds about him (and instantly forgot that horrendous season in championship he had) and Brewster is a young promising lad, but not first-team material yet.
And finally Flecky is back. Strong line-up that",88,Sheffield Utd,West Ham,Home,-1

Radio Sheffield as done it again open there big mouth telling you there are 16 mins left and look what happens the other side score a goal just like against man u lost the game by one goal when they said there was 12 mins left man u score.

"Same formation I see...but a good line up, think we‚Äôre all asking to see Didzy behind the front two and I agree with dropping fleck for Ozzy. Something slightly different, been critical of Chris for not changing but this is more varied and gives us pace up front so credit to him for the changes. I am feeling confident, come on Blades xxxx",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Home,-1
"This is more like it, for me mcgoldricks best position, he‚Äôs missing the pace for an out n out striker but has all the skill and craft to feed these two, put your money on Brewster to get off the Mark",148,Sheffield Utd,Everton,Home,-1

"C'mon Blades, let's upset the odds today and just maybe make other teams a bit jittery üî¥‚ö™‚öî",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"Baldock deserves to keep his place, and Bogle gives us much more attacking wise than Osborn. Osborn will definitely be on at some point. Probably a bit tactical, too, to make sure we have at least one midfielder on the bench.",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"Love those lads in our back 5 but 3 are out of position.
We‚Äôve played 433 most this seasons second half‚Äôs when losing. Can‚Äôt see why we don‚Äôt start that way and have 4 defenders playing their actual positions.
Hope I‚Äôm missing something",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
So we see a 4-4-2(1) formation with real battle get us 3 points midweek and revert straight back to the formation that‚Äôs lost so many games this season. I hope I‚Äôm wrong - COYRAWW üî¥‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
The only thing I have to look forward to now is seeing how much and where Lundstrum ends up - I‚Äôd say he shot himself in the foot but he‚Äôd miss,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Burke needs to be on at some point or we will never crack the defence.,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"The rot has set in , something sinister happening!
It‚Äôs the Sheffield United way ‚öîÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚öîÔ∏è",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"And this is the blessing of Jesus. To congratulate Pope Francis In the love My dear, by having your manager come up with a plan for the area of 6 places 4 and then ask the Lord Jesus and make a plan.",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Give Brewster a full 90 mins to show what he can do let‚Äôs hope our midfield give him something to chase ‚öîÔ∏è,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"This is a Brazilian strategy, it is a rivals' strategy against them and it will be like he fights against himself, let's see how he is.

This is a plan for Mr. Ralph Hasenhuttl's team, it is a defensive game where you will position 7 people by adding them to 8 and 9 in the defensive area and making the game use the location and map you want. It will be played in the manager's track, taking the position of 7 and 8, and then playing in the 4 and 5 and 3 man plans.To make the game in front of the goal frame, use the playing area of the players playing in the area. All come in and shoot the door.

This plan is to bring that sword back. I made a book for England to see, how fun it would be.",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"Go for broke.. nothing to lose and have a 4-3-3 attack
Mcburnie, Didza and Burke.. Replace Fleck as he has been poor this season ‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Ozzy for Lundstrum rest is as good as can be .2 -1 win today UTB,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Surely 442 would have been better served given the players we had available!?,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Great to see Bogle back! Hope hes 100%,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
We won.... #united,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"Omg!! The same shape that hasn‚Äôt worked all season - no creativity- we will go behind and change it with 20 to go, maybe 442 or 433 and look better - why not start with a different set up? What is gong through Wilders head this year?",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Come on united I've got money on you staying up first things first go above them nasty tesco bags #UTV #SUFC,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
There was a penalty and red card against burnley but rescinded by var (correct) burnley had two shots saved Arsenal had two shots blocked and hit the post.,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Osborn must have bummed Wilders dog.,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"I‚Äôm calling it now, Baldock will play centre back. Stevens LWB, Ampadu down the middle. Bogle RWB.",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Would much rather play 4 back . Than play a team of people out of position . Hopefully ampadu can lead the back line like he did after jags got sent off,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Top bins üóë from Norwood I think second half,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Not a bad team come on lads up the blades ‚öî‚öî,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
The penalty spot is decided at the foot,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
If we're losing by 60 minutes today would like to see some of the u23 players come off the bench instead of the usual lads we have come on for us!,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"Big call to put Stevens in the back 3,hope that's not going to backfire.",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Norwood out and put Osborn in,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Can someone tell Brewster not to raise his arm when taking the knee.,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
"I didn't even know blades were playing today. I can't watch them anymore this season, it's painful. Either way I hope they get something from it.",267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Is this really a 5-3-2 with Bogle at LB or are we gonna come out 4-4-2 and catch Southampton off guard?,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Wilder must have a bet on that he's never starting a 442 no matter how many players are out of position.,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Yessss the Bogle is back ‚öîÔ∏è,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2
Can't believe Osborne isn't playing,267,Sheffield Utd,Southampton,Home,-2

"How the hell is Redmond in team ... I‚Äôm starting to lose patience with this , he has been shocking ..... Adams and Ings have been building great partnership",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
A good team apart from you know who Adams more likely to get you a goal.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Would off left out redmond and would off played forster,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Your punching well below your weight !!! Play Che Adams . He can assist and his vision to pass forward is amazing and pass perfect if strikers are in the box üëå,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"The Redmond bashers are probably the same boo boys that wanted Forster out of the club last time his form dipped....

In Ralph we trust üòá",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I think Ward Prowse should teach Redmond how to kick the ball in the air.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I get salisu not starting being he has been injured with muscle problems for a while although I would like him to start lol but I would have given forster a shot,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Redmond? Needs to be confident in his ability rather than struggle on with poor form. Could be a world beater if he believed in himself. Surely the sports physiology experts can help!? We know he can do it. Very inconsistent,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Decent team... And more importantly a decent bench with options,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Great to see a strong team going out, saints have been playing well and not just the finishing has let them down but also bad luck with VAR and good goalkeepers. It will come together, keep believing",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I think Redmond must really be something special in training for Ralph to keep the faith with him. ?????,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Well what a load of critics we have here today, just get behind the team. Not long ago everybody was agreeing with Ralph.",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Foster and McCarthy are both quality keepers we‚Äôre lucky to have the choice!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Mccarthy a very lucky boy, redmond needs to turn up ball control shocking",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Strong team üëçüèª good to have the squad more or less back in one piece! Onwards and upwards!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Adams needs to come on strong as sub today. Redmond not my first choice but he may surprise us today.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
How the hell has the same team that played the other day not playing including Clean sheet Forster I trust,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Lots of experts on here with no experience. In Ralph we trust üëäüèª,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Beautiful block on defender by Redmond to allow Ings an easy shot at goal for the goal,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
¬£5 on Redmond to score a hat trick. ....,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Forster for McCarthy . Redmond ok but needs to bring his game today. Romeu ok but stop giving fouls away on edge of box n stop getting booked , otherwise go get 'em boys üëç",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Hopefully Redmond can run into more cul de sacs,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Forster back on the bench is a bit of a surprise,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Looks strong to me, and for once, some options from the bench COYR!!",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Not bad, but would have preferred Tella to Redmond and given Forster a chance ‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Redmond needs to learn how to beat the first man when crossing the ball....and forster should be given another shot Mccarthy has been shocking for a while now,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I wish he would bloody drop Redmond and McCarthy,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Disagree with the goalkeeping decision massively ..... forster deserves his shot üôàüôà,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Good luck Redmondüôå... happy to see someone else given a chance since Che has not been producing goals.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Might as well have derek redmond up ftont üòÜüòÜüòÜ,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
How is Redmond starting?! Should be Che.. Redmond needs a good game today üò©,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"On paper, great and formidable lineup. On the pitch, hopefully will deliver",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Just to put it out there (and I'm preparing to be slagged off)......... but I like redmond! Hope he scores the winner and everyone will love him again!!!!
#ficklefans",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Good Strong side although Redmond upfront is a bad choice Tella or Adams for me. anyways COYS give it some!! We need a good league run starting in ten mins time !!!!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Would of kept Forster in the sticks other than that good selection üëçüòá‚öΩÔ∏è,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"McCarthy and Redmond only changes that needed to be made , but should be strong enough to see off Wolves.",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Should of played Forster in goal,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Though Forster might get a chance.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Would have started Forster ahead of McCarthy but other than that about as strong as we have at the moment. Would like to see more of Tella today as thought he was excellent on Thursday,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
seriously losing the will to live ....why redmond and please give fraser a start in goal in the league hes playing really well in the cup,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Adams ahead of Redmond everyday of the week!!! In fact.........Te
lla, N‚Äôlundulu and my dead gran ahead of Redmond everyday of the week.........",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
At the moment I‚Äôd settle for a point. Just to get away from the 29 we‚Äôve been stuck on for an age now.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"I think Fraser will bugger off at the end of this season, played 4, conceded nil and MCCarghy has been conceeding for fun lately.....",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Jesus what the hell has McCarthy gotta do to get dropped? And Redmond, no end product, never has been never will be.",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"What can Ralph see in Redmond, that the rest of us cannot.?. Mind Boggles. Saints second bottom in current league form. Need win today. .?.",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Forster should be in goal.
Tella instead of Redmond.
Minamino pushed up with Ings.",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Forster and Adams should be starting!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
How he keeps going with McCarthy I will never know. What does Forster need to do üôÑ,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Redmond needs to have a good game today. Been playing terrible of late.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Back to our strongest line up if Redmond performs better. Adams in reserve...,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Redmond up front? Seriously? Do we not want to score ? Such a waste of space,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Would of played forster over mccarthy today,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I would have Forster in goal 4 games no goals conceded,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Why is Fraser not playing ?,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Foster tella (drop Redmond) and minamino up with ings,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
What more does forster have to doü§£? Joke.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Is this being televised?,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
How many own goals is Bednarek going to score today then?,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Forster should be in goal,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I like ralph but seriously McCarthy in goal?? ans then Redmond up top?,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Much better with all the players coming back.
Look much stronger now.",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
#GaOUT Salisu must be in first team,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Opportunity missed - Forster should have been playing,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Good apart from Redmond üëç,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Am happy for buying Takumi Minamino,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1

"A lot of pressure of McCarthy today , lucky boy to get his place again",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Come on saints Need 3 points to day,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Is that 4-3-3, or 4-3-2-1. Redmond needs a performance, would also stick with Forster in goal. Cmon you Saints üòá‚ù§Ô∏è‚öΩ",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Hopefully win for SAINTS & clean sheet...,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Redmond your having a laugh,",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Adams needs a goal. But not easy on the bench,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Where the hell would he put his arms fix,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
"Strong Lineup, its a must win",238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Oh well no clean sheet today with McCarthy in goal.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I would have Fraser Forster in goal,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Raphl try n bring on Mohammed bcos he is a real defence force.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
I fear a loss with Redmond playing.,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Another loss for us today then,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Forster should be starting instead of McCarthy and N'Lundulu instead of Redmond,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Interesting side with not many changes made which is good. Would‚Äôve had Forster in goal and adams up top but apart from that not a bad side at all üëè nice to see our bench is getting stronger again,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1
Get Redmond off!,238,Southampton,Wolves,Home,-1

"Michael, I think Cressy has done well as one of a centre three, I suppose mainly as a left back, he is always drawn more to the centre anyway! But Arthur has been spectacular don‚Äôt you think? He has so many good touches and silky skills with the ball at his feet and really good pace. With Cressy more central and Arthur as additional cover, we seemed to have solved our left back problem. However, I suppose because we have to use an additional
Player to solidify that position, is a waste of resource? What I found curious is Moyes decision to put Yarmo on when taking Ant√≥nio off? Even when Bowen came off, Yarmo was not showing anywhere near the same energy levels that Bowen was, even when he was so late in the game and had run himself into the ground. Found it curious that Moyes took off our central attacker to be replaced by a winger and not the 45 mil quid attacker on the bench, maybe that‚Äôs a sign of things to come!!

I know our Algerian friends are waiting for their man to play but news flash, he won‚Äôt be starting for a while at West Ham. The Premier league is a lot different to The Championship.

Proud of Moyes for not being bullied into rushing Benrahma and sticking with the players who've performed recently, he didn't rush Bowen and we all know that was the right thing for the TEAM and the PLAYER, Fergusson never rushed a player either,

I would've felt more comfortable with Diop's pace rather than Balbuena who had a bad first half against Spurs but we'll see and that's a strong bench aswell,

Also would feel more comfortable with Johnson on the bench than Fredericks who I do like but Johnson can play both wings and is more into defending, if Cress or Mas gets injured than we're back to one of them on the left in a back 4 üò¨ unless in that case Ogbonna plays left but Cress in a back 2, anyway i'm overthinking it ü§£

I wouldn't be surprised if it is 3 at the back with Neto as a wing back. Hope I'm wrong but can't for the life of me see us going in with no recognised centre back in a back 4.,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
I see the Siass move he can always slip into midfield and help out when required. Very attacking ...I like it,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1

"I hate being negative, but I really think a back 3 would have been better for this game. Have the donk sitting on Grealish, start Silva and have two out of three Neto,traore and podence starting.

What if the reason Nuno benched Boly is because Saiss is better than him when they play with 2 CB,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
No Big Willy today!! The magic happens outside the bubble and I think thats where Nuno has gone today. Something about this lineup looks very promising. Come on me babies.,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1
Brave selection here. Nuno probably feels Saiss‚Äôs positioning in a back four is better than Boly‚Äôs. His passing is definitely a lot more decisive. He must‚Äôve seen something in training to give Silva a chance. Good luck lads,120,Wolves,Aston Villa,Home,-1

Strongest lineup I think we currently have but would have played Kilman for Donk but with Max and Saiss both being left sided can see why Nuno has not gone for this. Hopefully Neto and Traore play closer to Jose again against a Leeds team that does concede goals.,250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1

Yup. Dendonker needs to play better but great to see the same side out again.,250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1
Good lineup - the question is whether they all come out of the dressing room in the first half and play some decent football ‚öΩÔ∏è Leeds will go at us in the first 45 assuming that we might be wobbly until we do our usual trick and turn it on in the 2nd half.,250,Wolves,Leeds,Home,1
