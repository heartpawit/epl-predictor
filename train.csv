"Major problem came when arteta decided to use 3 players in the left and throw in mustafi. You can't give xhaka, the slowest footballer a number 3 role against an attacking opponent like Leicester. Arteta killed the game with his rotation and game plan!",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"I think after watching the complete lack of creativity and how slow we are on the ball, letting the defence reshape while we pass around the back.... that we need a creative midfielder.... Ozil",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Someone is missing in this Line up, guess who?,,, #MO10 this guys knows how to disturb Leicester city's defense but because of arsenals stupidity is not present, so let us watch if we can win today",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Best line up! We expect positive result specially taking advantage coz we playing at home.The earlier we get goals is the better to put ourselves in a competition.God
Bless You Guys!üôè",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
many said the line up is strong. well i hope so. hope they dont get serious only in the final 10 minutes üíÅüèª still dont see any playmaker from those name either.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Great selection... This is how he should have lined up against city. Win today and in a great position,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
This midfield lacks that creativity and killer instinct. The 3:5:2 formation isn't working for us. We need to redeem ourslvs and go back to that possessional play that we know. We need to deny our opponents the chance to play by all means by having the ball at all times. Partey is good but if u wan play him with Xhaka who always plays the ball backward then we won't create enough chance. Atleast play 4:2:3:1. Anyway m not the coach.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
and they took away our love for football.l could handle 38 loses in a row but mistreatment of our own is an abomination,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"All those writing about Ozil here should form a new club ""√íZIL FC"" and leave this page..
THIS IS THE ARSENAL and no player is bigger than the club‚úä
I have been supporting Arsenal before he came and will continue to support when he leaves...Great line up",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"A Strong line up üí™ COYG forever, with aubameyang arsenal is going far but justice for Ozil, he deserve btr than this",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Strong line up. Come on the Gunners. The way the premiership is going this season we should be in the reckoning for a title run.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
He should have used this formation against Man City,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Great line up, although Xhaka remains a weak link as he doesn‚Äôt always seem to know what to do with the ball and often back passes, so having Elneny on would have been a better bet. But, it‚Äôs a decent team, overall. Now let‚Äôs get the job done. COYG!!",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Now this is the line-up i ve been yarning for all along ever since Thomas Partey came i hope they wont let me down.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Good strong line up Arsenal mean business. Need the win to keep on the top 6 trail. Just keep an eye on vardy, he has a habit of scoring against us......",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Partey,xhaka n ceballos tats dope...if we lose this game am sorry arsenal but arteta has done his best..it will be the players fault.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Great line up.. Am just worried with the system where we play from the back.. Leno always has more touches than Auba.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Good team, it can change formation 343, 541, 433,4231, depending on the opponent.#COYG",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Excited to hopefully see a 4 back! Ceballos with some freedom, Partey bossing the midfield. The boys up top tearing it up..",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Where is Ozil,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
This is the kind of lineup that can win games. Can Arteta please show us his real first team.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Strong line up! Let's be brave tonight up the front and show some solid defending at the back... We apparently are leaking goals whenever we face Leicester. COYGüí™üí™üí™,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
This is probably the best line up we have we must win. Our next 4 games are tough,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Ooooh is this the start of a 4-3-3 formation for Arsenal now? Time to play like Man City/Liverpool and thrash Leicester! No more 3 at the back! Interesting to see how this new formation goes for us,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Good Team Up but only that I would have start Elneny ahead of Xhaka. All the same We Move. COYG,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
I just hope they are tuned in and motivated enough to win this game. I would have preferred Elneny in place of Xhaka but all the same a decent line up.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Beautiful line up....I'd love to see Saka drive in from the right....
And Ceballos or Xhaka as AMF...
I'm excited",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Finally finally finally a deecent line-up ! With these players our best is 4-2-3-1 Xhaka and Partey DMS and Ceballos has the freedom to create !,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Promote Saliba already, Luiz is a liability and Mustafi shouldn‚Äôt be anyone‚Äôs second choice never mind first!",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"ALERT!! ALERT!! ALERT!!

Good news to all √ñzil fanboys

√ñzil will be hugely involved in todays game.
Yeah that's right, he will be busy watching and tweeting from the comfort of his home in London.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"At least I've loved arteta for once
Today's lineup is at least.. Come on gunners",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
This was my dream line up earlier today with Ceballos playing in an advanced role. C'mon you Gunners. We are The Arsenal,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Hope our game play isn't too defensive. We need to take the game to Leicester,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
I can't wait for Gabriel Martinelli to return from injury because Lacazette isn't doing the most . We need a number 9 that actually finds the back of the net.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
The easiest way of beating Leicester city is the Strikers must be aggressive avoid too much defensive it will lead to a penalty üí™üí™üí™,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"People busy talking about ozil when we all know that he isn't registered, we tired of this let's just forget and focus on what we have. Let's just trust the process and support arteta",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
I want a 6 - 0 FT so that the Ozil and media crap fades away,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Where's √∂zil?

All i see here is a draw match.

No creativity in the midfield.

Bring back √∂zil!",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"It's a strong line up, I hope they play well to give us the result we so desired.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
That Midfield trio and the attacking trio are absolutely outstanding! üî•‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Like the look of that team.. especially that midfield three should control dominate the game #COYG üî¥‚ö™,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Thank goodness Partey is starting. I was beginning to worry that we were going to stick to the Arsenal way and not play our new signing until 12 games later!!,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Attacking soo poor...after the game admin always be like 'not the result we wanted' arteta is slowly killing our arsenal,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
This should be a 4-3-3 formation,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
4-3-3 finally it was about time for that!,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Best Line up Arteta has provided so far,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Nicely done! Probably the best we can put out there with what we have! COME ON GUNNERS LETS MOVE TO THE TOP 4 WITH A WIN,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Are you going to shut up with Ozil ??? It's getting tiring. This player is finished. He's been bad for months and months. He is a slacker who walks on the ground ... He no longer made the effort. The team is clearly better off without him. Thank you Arteta for prioritizing the interest of the team...

COYG",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Decent line up! For once Willian is not a first choice player with the squad we have. Let‚Äôs get it done!,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
If we lose the match with this such a brilliant squad.. I Will know we are Not ready top 4 üò≠... COYG üí™,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Good line up Manager Arteta...it's upto boys to Fight like men and showcase their character and class..go Gunners.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Y he cant bench xhaka , partey and elneny is developing a good partnership and if partey doesnt have the ball how is it he is gonna influence the game, partey need to b more involve , we ave too much faith in laca he needs to start from the bench, honestly elneny is more crucial than we think xhaka is a waste , he is too slow and lack energy please start elneny,",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
This is the line-up we need mabye AMN in for bellerin and go from there come on you gunners,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Anxious to see how the squads will do and if there is any lazy and incompetent player, I suggest Arteta to not register them.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
We are going to struggle this season!! Tonight was a joke!!! So predictable no creativity no movement! I I love arsenal but it‚Äôs hard to watch knowing we have an unbelievable talent just thrown away like he doesn‚Äôt count!! MESUT OZIL!!!!!!!!,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"the results are not coming, we lost so many games already ..someone needs to take action",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"strong lineup.whatever
feelings I have I keep to myself and I urge all others to keep their ideas of who to play or not to themselves.ther
es a reason none of us is the coach.i know we are winning tonight",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"I think I hate how Arteta sets up this team...Honestly
, I have never seen any game after Arteta taking charge that Arsenal have come to a game roaring and ready to go...
With these kind of games we are a bittom half of the table team...mediocre",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Ceballos is officially free to roam, strongest possible line up at the moment. üëç #COYG",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Now that we have solid central midfielder in Thomas Partey, can we please bring back Ozil, can we also replace Xhaka with Elneny",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Hard to scored against a parked bus without decisiveness and creativity. Otherwise, it is like banging your head against the wall ‚Äî repeatedly. Rodgers outcoached Arteta, who either should have switched to pressing to catch LCFC‚Äôs defense when it was not set or stay back, cede the ball to the opponents, and generate counterattacks.
They did neither. Plus, club still needs leadership on the pitch.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Arsenal results from yesterday game, same old story's, when is arsenal going lmprove we are tired",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"That's our strongest line up . Partey and xhaka can hold whilst ceballos plays in the final third .

Come on arsenal ! 3 points takes us 4th",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Come on you Gunners! Hopefully we get the three points tonight. Very strong line up. Partey and Xhaka will provide the needed protection for the defence as well as link up with the forwards.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Willan, Pepe, Ozil. ????????? Not even on the bench......a draw or loss arsenal will remain 10th. Too bad",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"The only weak l saw in this line-up is David Luiz, all same l think is a good line-up that will gives us a mobility",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Tell where ozil is first then we may think about supporting you...,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Finally, we see a 4-3-3 formation with 3 clear midfielders! We've been waiting so long for this moment, let's see how Arteta's era start. COYG!",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"good and strong lineup all th best gunners...3poin
ts tonight",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Shame that arsenal voted for PPV so won't be seeing Partey in action ü§Æ,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Besides the inclusion of David Luiz instead of Saliba... This is the best Starting XI

If we lose this game it'll determine us not qualifying for the Champions League next season",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
This is a very good line up...Lacazette will exert more pressure on the Leicester city defenders,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Be careful Arteta with Leno
You need to work more on him
Nevertheless Leno is good Goalkeeper currently",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
This is strong line up hope finish the game off early avoid back passes keep possession high press bellerin and tierney need to push up help out midfield on wings so its constant up and down running for them in order to keep formation compact and effective,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Let Ozil pick up his money üíµ and go. He is the source of bad luck and could be interfering with the training program. Let him not train with the first team again. He is the source of confusion.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Bring back ozil, team need Creativity!
China doesn't like √ñzil because he supports freedom and democracy. Arsenal cannot succumb to the CCP. We cannot refuse to play for him because China.
CCP is against humanity, killing children, and threatening some organizations and countries to support their dictatorship with economic threats.Then someday you all thing will control by china.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Good squad‚Ä¶ but where's Ozil?,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
It was just wrong to start partey and ceballos at the same time. They were also awful. Partey cant even position himself to receive a ball. Nkt,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Talking about Ozil,what was the offers that Arsenal received for him in the last few transfer windows..",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Arteta, is eating the humble pie for his arrogance! How do you leave a creative playmaker like Mesut Ozil out of your EPL squad? You started well but now your arrogance and foolish decisions are negatively affecting the team. Anyway, the English officials hate us. That Lacazette goal should have stood! 1-1",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"This could be the best line up. We expect positive result and especially taking advantage playing at home. There should be no execuse. The. earlier we get goals the better we put ourselves in a competing position chalenging on top of the table.
Now players must be willing to go extra miles and prove their worth.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
How did Mustafi heal so quickily?,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Auba more worried about hair styles than scoring goals . Again I say, money wasted on him, so many many better strikers we could have bought and at half the salary . He says to be more decisive in front of goal but you see the way they play . Ya right !!! They can‚Äôt run at defense just pass pass pass . No direct shots testing goal keepers . The list goes on an on . 8th or 9th place . That is where this club is now .",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
We lost may be because Ozil is playing from home,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Not convinced with our attack, Auba always fizzling out in big games and Lacca needing 10 clear chances to miss before hitting posts, am a little nervous",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Arteta made a great mistake for ozil omission in this team when u have partey to cover up. We lack that final pass in our games and ozil is the only person who can give that to likes of Auba and lacazette. Our strikers can no longer score goals like before bcos we lack creativity. Arteta is all your fault. Let's see how it goes next. Up gunners,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"I AM TIRED OF HEARING THE OZIL STORY THE GUY IS NOT EVEN REGISTERED TO PLAY, WHEN HE HAD A CHANCE HE WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH UNDER UNAI, WE ALL KNOW HOW HE PLAYS TO LAZY TO RUN AND TRACK BACK",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Cant ask for better line up than thisüòç lets do thisüí™,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Willian not being available and Saka playing in with Ceballos Xhaka and Partey might prove out to be a blessing in disguise! We should press and attack from the first minute today!,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
I don't know when Arsenal management will understand that they are doing injustice to Ozil. Do onto others as you would like to be done to you,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"People keep forgetting that no matter how good ozil is he'll never give you a tackle.
With this line up partey and ceballos together a lot of chances will come in and of course a lot of breaking up play will come in too.

A player that can defend and create is such a gem.

Cc David luiz",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Why do most of you even support the club when all you comment is negative things? All I read in the comment is either, where‚Äôs Ozil or why don‚Äôt Arteta play him why is he playing there? When we get the win today you‚Äôll al be loving ArtetaüòÇ",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
A replacement of Bellerin would be very helpful to the team because the guy is becoming a liability.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Awesome line up, If only they can avoid back passes and play to their potential",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Sky have the formation as a 4-3-3 but I see it possibly as a 3-4-1-2 with Ceballos higher up the pitch, doubt he'd be playing on the right in a 3-4-3. Hopefully Ceballos can provide that creativity we need in the final third, just my thinking though, I could be completely wrong!",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Our supposedly big players not stepping up to the plate when we need them most.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Good team selection 4-3-3. I thought Saliba will make bench though! Let's go gunners, we badly need the three points",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Leno still has to prove to the team why he is our No. 1..otherwise we did a mistake of selling martinez,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"A very good lineup, we will drop points in the premier league but not today.
We are the FEARLESS GUNNERS.üí™üí™
Not forgotten 'human rights activists' are camping here for a lose
You shall wait for that moment in vain.
#COYG",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
No creativity in midfield after Arteta got rid of Ozil. I hope that Leicester will win this game,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Loving this lineup. Thank god this looks like a back 4. COYG! <3,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Great line up.
Let's come out and play with confidence 3 points is certain.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Happy with 4 at the back and Saka in the front 3. That‚Äôs why we signed Gabriel & Party. Arteta has done a good job in a short time. We have needed a world class CB & CM for years,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
No creativity in the midfield and thus affecting our productivity.# BringbackOzil.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Arteta is not worth the hype . How can arsenal win a match with this sort playing style - backward and side ways without real penetrating power! This team sucks big time!,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Stop it with √ñzil, ha hasnt been good or productive in years. He is a defensive liability and he doesn‚Äôt come close to the quality of play he had in Real Madrid anymore.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Gutted. Thought we should have won this one and drawn the City game. We need a couple of our players to have a little more attacking intent and directness to their game.
ie Right side and middle need to step up",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"The lineup looks so much promising.
With Lacazette starting, up front, Aubameyang will score. That's a guarantee. #COYG",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Playing like a championship team with long ball from the middle of the park, lack of creativity from the midfield. #Ozil we need you badly. Arteta time is running out.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Strong line up with a fast forward line. We should win this with ease even though Leicester City isn't going to be a push over. No mistakes at the back as was experienced when playing Rapid Vienna. COYG! üí™,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Tooooo much talk and pic do ur training keep ur head down....""All of them think thy r a good player coz thy r paid far far from what thy deserve"" all ziz players don't deserve to wear our jersey
Arsenal Forever ‚ù§üíØ",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Don't look at what the midfield lacks, look at how victorious we will be at the end of the 90th minute.",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
How did this starting eleven fail to win the game. Very worrying.,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
I think it's time Ozil replaces Xhaka. He's a world class player & we need his creativity,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
Ceballos is no Ozil - period! Our lethal strikers keep feeding on scrap. 4 games without a goal for Auba ü§îüò°,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
I am seriously excited about the line up. I hope the hope doesn't kill me this time. We should be winning this comfortably,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
It's ma kind of line up come on Gunners let's us win !,51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"It is a very balanced line up, I hope it works out on the pitch... Excited to see Partey start alongside Xhaka and Ceballos in midfield... #COYGüí™üèΩüí™üèΩüí™üèΩ",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"Where was the Captain, invisible on the pitch. Hard to watch this game and disappointed!",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
"So Saka is brilliant than Ozilü§îü§î
What's wrong with some people!!??
Wait and see how he's going to hold unto the ball longer ending up wasting the likes of Auba, Laca etc!
The boy has the potential to shine but not now! Give Pepe a chance!! Bring Ozil back, Arsenal needs him more than he needs them!!",51,Arsenal,Leicester,Home,-1
I am still confused what the hell is happening with Gunners as I had great expectations from last match but it all shattered. If such trends keep on then we are at the verge of drowning.üòîüòîüòî,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
On Ozil Arteta got it wrong . You can't waste that gem. My team receive more beatings to pump sense to their decisions,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"There is no passion for arsenal funs!!!because again we going to lost one seoson more to get champion.!how cant see arsenal boss anf management team arteta dosent couch of arsenal..i think arsenal need to wait more years to get champion,,,!!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Another complete mess at home, giving our critics the opportunity to rant at us that it is the same arsenal with different players, but rightly so. I keep talking about the sharpness upfront and the poor mov't off the ball. But hey! It is my team, Arsenal. I hope we get over this quickly and most of all improve better. Villa just taught us what to do.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta is a tactical genius. He is amazing at his team selection. Greatest coach in the world. What place are we in? What has changed from last year when he took over. Trust the process? If this is the process then he‚Äôs gotta go.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Lame performance from an entirely average team . No determination , no team plan , no commitment , no focus . Every body is just playing to earn his income .
It will take Arsenal great time to become a great team again and competitive in EPL . You rushed to sell Martinez when Leno is so averaged .
I hate Arsenal's board under Kroenke with a passion. You killed Arsenal as you refused to strengthen the team .
Edu and co also have great blame for signing players of similarity in almost every departments . No player is assigned to do the dirty jobs even Partey that is noted for this stuff is playing the dead Arsenal's way , most unfortunate",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"What a disgraceful performance! Saka and Bellerin were weak. Holding the same. And why dont Auba play in centre? Pepe has delivered 10 mins of good play since joining the club. Laca looks done, and Nketiah still isnt close to be a player for a team that want to be, and sometimes tries to get on the upper half in PL.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arteta has decided to take out ..partey for cebalos poor very poor now there is no defence from the center ..most crosses that converted to goal came from center to left wing ..and converted to goals we are doomed at Emirates shameful..glory
to Martinez",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Clocks running low for the arsenals faithful ......... arteta and the board are making arsenal look fools again I just can‚Äôt see where arteta is taking this team I don‚Äôt understand his game plan ???? Arteta needs to pull something out this season or I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs arteta out,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Poses the questions:
1. Why is Abba playing as a winger?
2. Why is Pepe not playing? (3rd in goals/2nd in assists)
3. How is Ozil not up to it in ""footballing"" terms when we couldn't score if all 11 Villa players left the pitch ...
Absolute rubbish ... at least losing under Wnger was entertaining",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Can someone please explain how in the hell does the 5-2-3 formation good for this team?
The only thing it causes is a huge gap in midfield with no creative connection between defence and attack
- Tierny playing CB instead of LB is absoulte maddness, his crossing ability is excellent and a waste as a centre back, instead saka should play up front and replace Willian.
This formation is the reason this team does not score much in the PL!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Can we all just take a second to appreciate Elnenys resurgence under Arteta. What a player he has turned out to be. Especially with Partey along side him. Great partnership. üëèüèº,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arteta finally brings back the same team he played with in the last PL game, you can't just keep on blaming him for rotating the squad, even Klopp took 5 years to reach where Liverpool is today! And moreover just give Arteta 75 mil to bring in both Aouar and Szoboszlai and see what a havoc he creates! #COYG",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"If I am not mistaken, Arteta name his same line up as last game for the first time.

Pretty good enough. Fresh from wonderful match between City vs Liverpool, full of quick attacking and defensive masters. Hope Arsenal can do the same but score the goals pls.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"In a game like this I would of given Willock a start and leave Willian on the bench and leave out Xhaka completely, Willock has done well in the European games and deserves a chance in the league",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I lost interest in Arsenal the moment the Board started tutoring Ozil. Since then I always struggle to watch our games ... The passion is no more,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Three points please we can't afford to lose this one we must maintain our number or improve it on the league table, good luck",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Good balance team selection and a strong bench as well. We need to win to stay in touch at the top end.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willian needs to be dropped. You can't tell Pepe to work hard and win his place when Willian has not done enough to start,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I want to see PEPE,WI,AUBA,LA
CA BOOM. ALSO WANT TO SEE OUR MIDFIELDERS SCORING GOALS LIKE OTHER TEAM. 3 POINTS FOR SURE",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Finally crossing my fingers it's a 4 at the back system. We can get a more than 1 goal lead. All the best lads.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta is so naive n that will cost us dearly. .Why does he always bench Pepe n start with Willian? Hard to be n African in Europe.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Keep the winning 11.. Willian definitely drained .. all we have is a bit of experience from a tired leg. Hopefully Pepe or willock gets minutes to fight for the shirt in the second half,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This is unfair for Pepe, every time he delivers a great performance then he‚Äôs dropped to the bench irrespective of how Willian is performing",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Regardless of whether he‚Äôs in form or not, this is the type of game you pick Elneny for. Absolute engine who will hunt down our biggest threat - Grealish.
So pleased he‚Äôs finally getting the recognition he deserves.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I believe Pepe should be in the starting 11.He has been great. If we keep on benching him he will start having second thoughts and will have his mind elsewhere..,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Pepe should have start, William needs to step up, he hasn‚Äôt been aggressive enough on the ball for me. However every other players are in good shape..",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This lineup consistency means Arteta is edging to settling on his starting 11, which is great. All the best to the team. COYG!!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great squad there, let's pick the points early today, save us from 90 minutes of chest pains",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The match will start in 1:45 AM in our country.I am waiting not sleeping also I have work in the next day.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Sorry, Willian is playing like a veteran at the moment. He should be nowhere near starting. He brings nothing to the team, and offers nothing during the game.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I love Mo, bit part player, goes off on loan, comes back proves a point and now is a regular. Prime example of if you work hard enough you will get it. Reminds me a bit of Coquelin who did similar",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"3 at the back again. This makes me sick...We should go for 4 at back and start acting like a big and elite club again...It seems like we do timid with 3 at the back, to be honest...",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Unchanged squad for first time, we are going to get same result hope so",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Pepe should‚Äôve started over Willian but we get it Artetas signing given special treatment!!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Hoping for 4 goals today. Villa is a good side but arsenal is better. Going for a win,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The first time with the same team from last premier league match,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
One piece is missing... bring back Ozilüí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great line-up,this team will surely exploit villa,would have loved to see willock but I am sure Arteta has his reasons",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Chiefs lost again and I hope you guys are going to make my night please.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Holding X Gabriel solid, Elneny X Partey midfield bosses. It's 3 points in bag.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Pepe should be starting but apart from that I‚Äôm happy. C‚Äômon Arsenal!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Maybe Pepe should stop scoring/
assisting goals, because whenever he does he seems to get dropped lmao...ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£ but anyways... COYG!! üî¥‚ö™Ô∏èüí™üèª",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
This is the best squad we have had for a long time. Starting eleven is backed up with a formidable bench.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Same team for the first time, consistency is key.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Good to see he‚Äôs keeping this solid line up. Our best starting 11 for sure.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Only way this would be better if Pepe was in for willian, apart form that it is a great lineup and good to see him stick with El nenny with partey",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Good to see he kept a winning team. It‚Äôs the only way to get consistency üí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Enough with Lacazette, play Auba down the middle and 4 in the back. Laca a waste of space and cannot take his opportunities. Every time the ball falls to him I have no confidence in him to finish",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"The information is not bad but we lack of creativity and this information can‚Äôt work with our lack of creativity.
I think Arteta need to bring Ozil back in January or he should sign another creative mild fielder.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Apart for a couple positions that are debatable, this is probably our best 11 at the moment !!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Horrible team ! Lacazette and aubameyang are walking on the pitch and saka has no brain to play football !,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
No juice in this team... no creativity where 's the construction ..mentally also something missing... hey my Gunners you can do better,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
When will you guys realize Ozil did nothing for 90% of a game and certainly nothing defensively we cannot afford a luxury player like him!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Laca such a chance has to hit the Target.Otherwis
e his stay as a centre forward will be very short lived.What does he want to score.From Liverpool games he has been missing open chances.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
We don't need Williams & Laca in our squad.They are the problem facing our team We'll regret the action & face relegation if care is not taken,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We can see clearly what we do wrong on the pitch, all actions was going of the flank, so, atacking midfelder needed in our game, to play more in midle, to atack in that zone, If we play with Willock or Ozil like a 10, we can be more dengerous!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Seems like a good team selection, my only concern would be Willian and the fact that we have some really exciting young players that can‚Äôt seem to make the bench, let‚Äôs hope for a great game",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We miss ozil no creativity , aubameyang not interested playing on the right , you watch all the training videos they post everytime and ozil is training with the first teams and the one making the final passes for a finish but he can't play in any squad ü•¥ü§®",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"That is our strongest team at the moment, love it! Come on Arsenal! üí™",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Arteta is right to maintain this team once again... Lets see if we gonna keep it up... Lets go gunners üí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Why does nketiah always make the bench he contributes nothing better to put willock or at least Cedric it's so frustrating,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"THE ARSENAL ATTACK IS COMPLETELY DEAD, NO FORCE, NO QUICK REACTIONS NO GOOD MOVE, NO GOOD ATTEMPT, PLAYING LIKE PRIMARY SCHOOL PLAYERS, ATETA NEED TO DO A VERY SERIOUS WORK ON THAT ATTACK, BECAUSE WITH THIS THE TEAM CAN NOT GO ANYWHERE..",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willian keeps on playing shiet but gets the nod...only player that seems undropable under mikel...swear if Mari doesn't play b4 January then definitely ozil omission wasn't arteta's decision,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
So why did we really Get Ceballos back on Loan??!!!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
We need Ozil back on the team. No creativity at all.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
The link between Partey and Elneny is working they can be able to stop Grealish since they were able to boss Pogba and Fred in the middle of the park and Gabriel a magnificent signing but the boys will win today our defense has improved this season just make sure the boys take one a game at a time and play the Arsenal way,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"We need to change our style of football in order to achieve better results auba is a center forward,willian
is a free role midfielder nd wee need to be consistent",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I trust this kind of team selection from our own Mikel and happy to see a consistency in that . We gonna win the game,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
You lost today.. you better bring back Ozil.. This team is so annoying,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Willian should do something reasonable tonight!! he has been a liability,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Arteta‚Äôs selection and substitutions are very poor. What is Saka doing on the pitch. Elneny is not up to his game and instead of taking him off, he rather takes of Partey. Willian is performing well and Saka is not but he chooses to substitute Willian rather. Poor substitutionsüò°",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"I hate to see Auba on the wing, Ceballos and Pepe on the bench. Arteta has got players to win games but he keeps using the attackers on the wrong positions. I just hope we win and not settle for a draw",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great line-up,but Pepe is the best over Willam.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Not a team! Never been a team! Got a few results by chance, and I'm glad the true Arsenal is showing up! Awful or do I say woeful....",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"The arsenal forward lacks consistency. Stick with
Auba, laca and Pepe game in game out.
Mid table team we should always use 3:4:3.. it will give the team the balance in the mid.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Absolutely rubbish this format of back passing doesn't work against small teams,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Very good this is the first team selection for us moving forward üí™üí™üí™,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
There is 3 kind of results in football...but today we need only one of them....that's wins only!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Genuinely one of the most inept performances I‚Äôve seen from an Arsenal team, the players just seem to care, they thought they just had to turn up after winning at Utd.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Our strikers should be much more lethal, while attacking for us to gain the 3 points.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
So happy to finally xhaka on the bench. Hope el nenny can maintain the same form like last week,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Should have put Runarsson in for Leno to give Leno a break because this team isn‚Äôt as good of a opponent and can‚Äôt always have the same goalkeeper every game they get tired just like every other player,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"PL needs one 11 squad, experiencing players happens during pre-season.
This kind kills the morale of players and we will never get a result.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"With a performance like this top 4 will be unachievable. The whole team was poor to say the least. If you can't beat Aston villa, it leave much to be desired. Disgusting!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Again conceding an early goal...We need to win...Come on guys...35 minutes have passed...It would have been 2-0..Please ensure 3 points...,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I‚Äôm quiet happy with this line up tbf would have been nice to see willock at least among the subs but come on arsenal 3 points please,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Saliba cant make the bench. A towering 1.90m fast defender that commited almost no fouls in french league. That boy can make our defence unbreakable if only arteta could see.training means nothing game day saliba can step up,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Apart from 2 assist in fulham game, Willian was excess baggage in the field. Cause he lost the ball twice and didnt win it back started our misery today's game.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This team is a real joke, no creativity, poor defense and mikel has more to learn, the team needs a real manager, Poch is available",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Tierney needs to play as the LWB not saka needs to be pushed further forward,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Better to use ceballose instead of lacazette, to improve creativity.
Then the formation should be 3_4_1_2, auba and pepe at the front.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"This is our time to shine, this is the best line up so far ever since.... Please Mr. Arteta stick to it. Another 3 points to take",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
No need to change the winning Team that beat Man united...This lineups is Great.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Best team possible üî•
For those who criticize shut up once and for all ... False supporters ... Are you a manager? Arteta knows better than you. He does a great job. He brought in two great players Gabriel and Partey. He had the courage to kick out the parasites for the sake of the team. The team has become solid and it's getting better offensively even though there is still work to be done. A little patience, we are not on a game console ...

Go gunners!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Better from Arteta, same 11... Let's build the cohesion...",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Before we jubilate , remember this team Aston Villa smashed Liverpool 7 Goals .So don't underestimate it.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
We losing you mean its 0-1 half time we have no creation..... We missing a man he is home he have no invite to come.. #bringbackozil,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Anyone else think that the current formation is compromising the talents of the best players to accommodate guys that are not performing? It has been four league games since we scored from open play while losing two homes games in a row is not acceptable.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
It's a big mistake to all the entire team which was done in goalkeeping since from the time you decided to offload matinenze.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Fake lineups, willian, Lac and Ceballos they should not start at all!
Nile, Nketiah and Thomas, Holding is also very weak!!",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Where is Ozil for heaven's sake?,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Coming here when we are already 1 nil down. Willian doesn't offer much. I hope he improves,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"The board playing politics with our best creative midfielder is bad , if they know they wanted to do this, then they should have brought money out for auora....",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Not comfortable with Willian pick though.. Willock better,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Stupid line up. Its fact. Boring boring arsenal. Mr arteta. Dont you see arsenal need AM. Where do you your mind???? Just sell auba, laza, william and also elneny. Just a bus passengers. Bring back ozil. Boring boring arsenal never change",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Consistency in team selection.... Nice!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"As funs we must accept the either three outcomes of the game,,,loose,wi
n or draw buh it's painfull when ours lose",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"When Saka can't play well, we hv no chances... The team is relying on 19yr old boy... The 19yr old boy is only the good player in the team ü§£ü§£
Where is the authority or fans who told William is the very good transfer for Arsenal??? If William is good enough to play in EPL, Chelsea won't bring Werner or Ziyech to EPL ü§£ü§£
Where is the one who pays 72Millions for Pepe??
Where is the one who told Laca is better than Giroud??
Where is the one who let Ramsey out and Thomas is like Vieira ü§£ü§£
Where is the one who tell Arteta is very good Coach??
No plan , No changes while losing....
Dont tell Villa has used money ü§£ü§£
Arteta is using the striker who has not played well in Championship ü§£
See how Wattkin plays, See Grealish plays... And also see Nkietia and Laca play, William and Pepe play ü§£ü§£
So funny
Arsenal is just the team that show disrespect to the fans",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Araenal has a small team mentality with Arteta. They play to not lose instead of playing to win!,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"They scored as in 49 seconds and VAR saved us ...
Rescored us because of Holding .. He couldn't move to the guy before his pass for agoal
What a mess of tonight ... And am seeing they have dug a hole at right back of us",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Way to go,,we dont change a winning team
But
Let's try to create clear cut chances,, that's been the main problem",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"..And ELNENY is the melon you're avoiding to mention, the cause of the current turn of events, the failure we're facing now..but no one sees nor notices.",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
I expect the same level of commitment they displayed against a mediocrity team by the name of Man United,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Great team selection. This is a sure win with at least a 3 goal difference, let's show Martinez some love with the goals üí™üí™üí™",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Small village park elneny can't boss
And is like party over for Thomas",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Just play Aubameyang central and see how we win every match.,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
This is our best line up but I prefer Lacazette to come from the bench and Auba as our Number 9 Saka and Willian on the wings,71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"Willian is a tourist at Emirates stadium, not a player... he is the cause of the Villa goal. Easily loses the ball and has a very low work rate off the ball",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
"What was that.. !!!! biggest waste of ¬£15 pay per view, villa at home! Disgraceful",71,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Home,-3
Good line up but we lost. The manager is the problem,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
I see no reason why Ozil is missing out from Arsenal. He could be useful with his creativity,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Arteta continues to try to justify Willian by continuing to select him in the hope of getting one good performance..bu
t it isnt happening.. how bad does a players form.need to be to get dropped",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"I‚Äôm happy Luiz is in for Holding....he is a much better footballer, although always prone to a Howler every so often. Xhaka is very average....and no goals, time to get rid of him, Ceballos is over rated.....runs around a lot but again.....no assists and no goals. Willian is a good footballer but for some reason hasn‚Äôt shown anything yet at Arsenal. Saka is a brilliant young prospect but is not a goalscorer. Nketia will never be Premier League standard alongside Nelson, Willock, Holding, Chambers and Maitland-Niles.

We need top premier league players in our team not simply reasonable quality youngsters.
Hurry up and get shut of Ozil and a number of others.
It‚Äôs going to take a couple of years and lots of investment to get us back anywhere near where we all expect to be......but I do think Arteta is the man to do it.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"The said problem is there are no goals in this midfield.....in
fact.....in the team. So if Auba fails to score (or we get a goal from a set piece) then we won‚Äôt score. We desperately need a creative midfielder and a proven goalscorer (no 9). Auba on the left cutting in......",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
No Ozil and there is no a real replacement for that position one game win the other game loose due to lack of creativity I that is Arteta style. In the end of the campaign we will be on the bottom of the table anyway let Arteta continue his poor style of tactics,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"We need to win! Not draw or lose. Again and again...I hope and really hope to see both W, William and williock to do well for us. I do not know why willock always in the list but hope he can do us proud. No point talking about ozil now, wasting time and meaningless. Just pray that everybody can play their role well. Get it done please, Gunners!",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Coaches that know what they doing they don't scream through out the match they do their home work on the training ground, thus what we saw in the game between Chelsea and Tottenham, hope Arteta won't be screaming also on the line today.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Balogun should at least be on the bench instead of the clueless Nketiah..pairin
g Xhaka and Ceballos in the midfield is just terrible
The rest are okay
Good luck but we still miss Ozil",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Don't know what Willian do for Arteta? Otherwise this man don't deserve a place even in the bench. And there is another boy of Arteta, just like him... Willock. Really frustratingüò§. Leave Ozil, Nelson is there, Smith Rowe is there, Bolagun is there. But Arteta's eye can't find them.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Decent team. David Luiz uses his brain üß† application to good and effective use. You cannot outwit or bully him. What he lacks Gabriel will provide for. Same like was Per Mertesacker. Not the best of defenders but they get the job done more often than not.
Willian questionable selection. Would put Nelson instead.
But he is the manager. We only have opinions or our own layman's and objective selections. We are very objective and also subjective as he also is.
Wolves no easy opponents. We will be watching.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"It's good to see Willock trying his luck, hope he uses this chance well. Our team lacks possession and proper distribution. Hoping today will be different... Keeping fingers crossedü§ûüèø",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Yes I'm not happy when we lose but we complained too much,the match hasn't started yet but some of you are already complaining about this and that.
The earlier you accept it the better,we are no more a top 3 side in EPL looking at the last time we won the premiership so kindly calm down since we have a long way to reach our past level or status, thanks.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"A year ago the club fired a fraud who claimed to be a coach, a year later we find ourselves in a worse situation, could it be we got the coaching situation wrong again ü§î?..<><><>",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Badly needed Partey for this game to give us composure and strength in midfield.
Ceballos and Xhaka give the ball away too much",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"We are used to this.It will be the same disappointment.
I lost trust in this team.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
Same team that lost to Villa and got a point from the Leeds game.,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Y pay Ozil that amount of money and he is sitting there doing absolutely nothing knowing very well no one is going to come in and buy him ; you might as well use him! The you're lacking is creativity , you have got a player that can do that. #Gunnersforever",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
We need a creative in our midfield. Otherwise the it will be the same old story,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"How does Willian keep getting in this team!!! Nelson is type of player we need at the moment, direct, no fear and makes things happen.. Willian just slows it down!!!",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
Would have liked to see Balogun make the bench deserves a chance. Willian needs a big game tonight he‚Äôs been a passenger!,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
That xhaka thing another nightmare pliz save as guys tomorrow is monday we shall go to work,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Great line up, let's get behind the squad.. We are expecting alot of creativity from Saka and Ceballos",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
willock is a bad omen this boy should be loaned to championship,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"What did Willian do to deserve a place ahead of Nelson???,Luiz out Holding is doing fine.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Saka starting with Auba gives me a bit of hope. At home, wolves will be a tough test. Strong defensive unit, see how the midfield battle pans out. Won‚Äôt be easy but got to give everything we got. Hoping Auba steps up and delivers a little more than he has as of late.

COYG!!!",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
what does Holding have to do really? our defence is stable when he plays but we keep on playing our suspect Luiz.....,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
There is something between Arteta and William that the FA needs to investigate because I don't know how he gets picked week in week out,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
Me going to work tomorrow depends on you. I definitely won't have the energy to face my Man United workmates after what they have done to Southampton. Please give me the courage and energy by getting all the 3 points üôè.,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Save us from humiliation and ridicule for once, we have suffered enough. COYG.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1

When you see Willian in the line-up üòÇüòÇ,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
Nelson should have started ahead of Willian.. the boy is hungry to fight for a spot in the starting 11... love his energy.,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Sincerely speaking nelson should start instead of willian...artet
a Is biased",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"I was hoping to see Reiss Nelson starting the match ahead of Willian. Nelson had a pretty game away to Molde, he surely deserves to be given a chance.

#COYG",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"We must loose again.....why would u bench holding for Luiz, and why bench lacazette in a match like this, willock should have been replaced by Nelson atleast in a 4231 formation. Poor arteta!",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"At least gervinho dribbles 4 to 5 players before loosing the ball ,William dribbles himself before loosing the ball",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
Nelson should have started over Willian. Why keep playing Willian who under performances every game.,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
What did David Luiz do to deserve first eleven when Rob holding is doing well,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
Why is Willian still starting ahead of Nelson...Why Arteta ? why ?,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Every time I see Willian‚Äôs name on the team sheet, a piece of me dies. Been utterly useless since matchweek one.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
I guess appeasing China is more important than playing the player we need the most,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"If u like play Willock 100 games he will never play like Ozil nor Fabregas..Willo

4231 formation but our midfielders are slow,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
You can't win a march without controling the midfield. You can't control the midfield playing kids. You can't win this match. Hopeless Arsenal. Show some ambition in your team selection.,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"I would like to see William Saliba to play soon. Maybe not the tough games but maybe against teams like Burnley, Sheffield etc.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
Don‚Äôt want to see ‚Äúnot the result we wanted‚Äù please.,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"We don't have any playmaker to assist , we don't have any good wing, we are the less quality at centr have positions at top six",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
Willian? Thought Nelson had a good few games starting to hit form.,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
Arteta has began to lose it... What's willock doing in this game and why is David Luiz always backing off when attackers are coming... It's seriously annoying that we are still playing this way,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"When will we see William Saliba play? He is one of the most promising defenders and they do not even call him, we play with a William who charges more than he pays, a midfield more defensive than creative, sometimes even Auba has to go down to receive the ball, this team is painful",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
We desperately need huge signings in January! üòì,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Be prepared to loose . Never underlate ""small teams"" ..it will end with tears",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
And still the Ozil lobby is alive and well. At least he has a world cup medal.,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"I don't know what is happening to this team. Losing has become a very popular thing about arsenal. I don't know whether these guys even train or not....... No motivation starting from the coach, backroom to the players. Players are just playing as if someone forced them to play... Very unepressive",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Guys in you we trust today. Plz don't let us stay locked inside coz of man-U fans. Plz win us this game. And to you aubemeyang, enough is ENOUGH. Make us proud n show us y you are being paid that huge amount of money.",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"Ceballos and Xhaka too slow at spotting the right forward pass in transition from defence to attack, I fear we may have the same problems! Let‚Äôs hope Willock can put Aubameyang in for a few chances! He needs to pick the ball up a bit deeper and run forward with it, looking for the runs of Saka and Aubaüëç",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1

I don't know wht to say. Got so many players but cannot play them on their rite position. Got creative player but put him out of the squad. Arteta is former arsenal player n he should know how to use all the players. Y not arteta use all the knowledge he have when he was at man city to use in the arsenal team so that the team can play good football. If former player can't manage the team n is better for the team to have a good manager,91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1
"I am not rating Willian at all and also why doesn‚Äôt he play players based on there performance
Instead of players that are doing NOTHING but yeah come in arsenal do this do something please.....",91,Arsenal,Wolves,Home,-1

"I really wish to see Arsenal having a starting line up that will play 5 games in row and a formation to play under.

"Are you stupid? Partey is coming back from injury, it makes sense that he won't start",171,Arsenal,Crystal Palace,Home,0
Who is David Luiz from where ?? Nkt Pablo mari is the best centre back with Rob Holding,171,Arsenal,Crystal Palace,Home,0
Am afraid this team is going to lose... Arteta should be sacked before he leaves Us all with ulcers,171,Arsenal,Crystal Palace,Home,0

"Apart from shelvey and Lewis, pretty good team, attacking for a change, even if we lose at least we have a go",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Once again, Bruce misses the point. It's not about how many forward's he has on the pitch, more about midfield runners and team set up. Wonder when we will get a decent manager again?",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Hahaha Bruce is now trying to mix things up and you‚Äôve all changed your minds and wanna be a defensive side against better opposition!! Never be happy.... stop supporting the club ffs,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Surely should've been this lineup against Sheffield United and that one against Arsenal.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Why drop Hayden ?? He‚Äôs been our best midfielder.
Joelinton ! Really ??",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
I'm looking forward to seeing this team play. Not been impressed so far with Lewis and thought Ritchie might be a better bet but what hey...let's give it a go. Don't know if Arteta foresaw this lineup so Carroll v Holding could be quite a tussle. HTL.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Where's Sch√§r? Surely he hasn't proven worthy of getting dropped. He's one of strongest defenders right now.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Why do we play 5 at the back against Sheffield United but against Arsenal we play 3 up front üò° #bruceout,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
One extreme to another. This team would have been great against Sheffield and a more defensive one for tonight.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"I have never liked Bruce, he‚Äôs not the right man for the job but he plays 5 at the back and ultra-defensive
and gets hammered for it, he switch‚Äôs to a more attacking team and many people are like we are going to get hammered, have a day off!! It‚Äôs no wonder we get hammered by every other set of fans! 90% of our fans are never happy!! If we get turned over tonight but had a go that‚Äôs all we can hope for from the current bunch of players! We are never going to be pulling up trees so maybe get behind the bloody team for once!!",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
The trend in the PL is to have fast footed players quick runners why are we playing slow footed away from home apart from Almeron who can‚Äôt do all the work they should have Atsu Gayle Ritchie all quick runners when away from home rather than letting the defences away from home having a holiday just my opinion,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
To be fair I think he‚Äôs going all out giving the fans what we want it just if they have a clue when they out on the pitch just have a go it‚Äôs about personal pride for them players it can‚Äôt be nice to get beat all the time a few harsh words from Bruce I hope a dig from darlow other day so I hope they have had it out and start playing for each other,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Think Matty is in for a very busy afternoon picking up the slack from shelvey and being the one to close wider positions down. Personally I would be playing Gayle in this formation,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"This is Bruce doing it his way....Last time this happened we got spanked in pre season by Wolves. Think this is a recipe for disaster, got a lot of players on the field that aren't very mobile. Caroll, Joelinton, Shelvey. Arsenal will destroy us here.",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Ffs this should‚Äôve been the side v Sheffield united...makes no sense to play it against a better quality of opposition...Br
uce is a melt",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Steve when you start letting so called supporters influence your decision making its time to call it a day The fact of the matter is we are basically a championship side punching above our weight for the last few seasons Chopping and changing players and systems is a recipe for disaster Grow a pair and get back to basics ie,Play your preferred system with your preferred players Cut the social distancing out and get in opposition faces Battle for every ball Basics Not rocket science Otherwise its a case of Adios and Hasta la vista to the premiership",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Joelinton and shelvey man ffs we'll lose it on the flanks neither Kraft or Lewis can defend or keep hold of the ball. At least Carroll and Wilson start together.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Delighted Sean's been dropped for this one. Matty deserves a run in the team. Would have preferred Murphey in place of Joelinton especially with Big Andy in the team. Would have also gone with Hayden instead of Jonjo. Looks like an attacking line-up on paper; just hope they actually do attack, but knowing Brucey we'll have Almiron and Joey as false wingbacks and a back four -- so effectively a back 6 üò´",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Bruce: The gloves are off, I‚Äôm going to do it my way

Also Bruce: Picks team that everyone has been wanting him to pick.",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"If you were doing it your way Steve, Joelinton, Shelvey, and Carroll would be no where near this squad... oh by the way it‚Äôs January? You know the month we sell players and bring fresh ones in? Chop chop üëè",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Glad to see carroll joe and wilson start together but rest of team is dodgy apart from clark,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Here we go, 4 forward players in one team, the swashbucklers are back!!!! #bruceballbaby",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Surely Yedlin should be staring instead of Krafth. He's not the best but he's better than Krafth and has some speed for attacking. Bruce seems to not have a clue who to play, but not surprising.",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Where are the footballers. Expect to see the ball flying through the air,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Where was this against Sheff united üôà,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Not sure bruce knows what hes doing lol picked a very defensive team against sheffield and we lost now hes playing a very attacking team against arsenal makes no sense.. if we loose hell probably come out and say ‚Äú thats why i dont pick attacking team ‚Äú üòÇüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Better to have a go then trying not to lose. Would have probably gone with Richie instead of joelinton but decent line up, good to see Carroll and Wilson up top üëç",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Back 4 and 2 up front, bruce has stuck to his word formation wise to look like they are going to give it a go. Let's hope the tactics and players are looking just as positive. And get behind Joelinton ffs",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Time for 'gloves off' ü§£ü§£ü§£

7-0 Arsenal, and good god I hope this is the last match with Bruce in charge, he needs getting rid....it's embarrassing...
.",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Much more attacking line up. Let‚Äôs hope the performance is also much improved!,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Bruceless out to start with. Joe nogoals holding his hand Joe cannot score doesn‚Äôt matter how much he cost. Useless. But no. Quite bruceless,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Does it matter what lineup he goes for people would still moan. I think this is quite a decent starting 11,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Not much pace in the team, lump it forward for Carroll and than hope for something to happen by the looks of it",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Hayden and Murphy would of gave us a better chance. Murphy can deliver a ball. Joelinton can not. Hayden gets stuck in shelvey does not,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
And that‚Äôs the best we can muster? Mrs can have the tv for married at first sight I think!,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Worst team so far this season, bruce couldn‚Äôt pick his nose.",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
the first game on our road to the top. The gloves are off as Bruce said and there‚Äôs not a man will get in his way. Well bar ten man Fulham and Sheffield united,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
I guess he is under pressure and has had to pick a more adventurous team though I think we will lose and he will say TOLD YOU SO as his excuse.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Carrol and lascelles at centre back,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
That actually looks like a more positive line up. Once ASM is fully fit this should look better. It‚Äôs a shame he‚Äôs only been back in training a little while,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Haha watch tonight we get battered playing 442 lol something we've needed to do for ages! Done well in the cup.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
I would have had Hayden rather than Shelvey to offer some protection to the back line.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Where's Dwight Gayle????,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Don't get to excited Carrolls playing centre half lol,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"So Lascelles will gas out, Lewis will break up any potential move forward and Joelinton will stroll around wondering how long it takes for a giraffe to be sick. Can‚Äôt wait!! üôà",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Don‚Äôt get Krafth and Joelinton, Hayden over Shelvey too but otherwise as good as it gets at the minute",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
What's joelinton gotta do to be dropped,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Rather have Murphy, Anderson or Ritchie on than joelinton.",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Great to see the Carroll and Wilson up top together or is Carroll playing centre back ? Lol,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Knew he will put Joelinton back, hat trick time for our No 9",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Honestly its the team newcastle fans been waiting for 433 look if Wilson and joelinton drop back fair enough but we aint kicked a ball all still slating them lets get behind them as much as we can if he picked one striker fair enough but 433 against arsenal is a positive lets think that all we want is now the players to attack and go for it howay fellow geordies lets support our mighty toon,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Always stuck up for shelvey, but needs to put a performance in tonight. Been a bit lazy in his last few appearances and not really done what he should/can do",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Stop giving the ball to Darlow. As good at stopping shots as he is, when he‚Äôs given the ball under pressure he just hoofs it to an Arsenal player üôà. Play forward not backwards üôà.",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"just listened to Neville and Caraghar,,telli
ng it like it is at NUFC,,,and both telling the truth...",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Listening on bbc and commentators saying Bruce hasn't been backed but to my recollection, Lewis, Hendrick, St maxim, Fraser, carrol, wilson and joelinton are all his signings",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Like the change in attitude. However Kraft got battered by these down our right in the cup and Joelinton being in the team is as good as being down to 10 men,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Shelvey and Joelinton are not the best choices. Well this is his team gloves off so see how pans out...üôàüôà,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
I'm confused. Play defensive against poor attacking teams then field an attack minded lineup against a better attacking team? Isn't that backwards?,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Joe must have a clause in his contract. So many appearances a season. Only way I can explain it.
Last week or the week before, little 19yr old Matty was strong on the ball and didn‚Äôt give away possession. Big Joe couldn‚Äôt control a pass and got bullied off the ball, he‚Äôs 6ft odd y‚Äôknaa?
I think he‚Äôs probably a nice person but there‚Äôs a reason that Rafa said no to that deal.",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Or maybe Bruce has realised joelinton can't do anything up front so he's playing him as a defender which means we still have 5 at the back üòÇüòÇ,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Why not start this team against Sheffield we would of battered them,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Take Lewis, krafth and shelvey out get Ritchie, manquillo and Hayden in and it‚Äôs probably one of our better teams",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Confused Bruce says from now on I'm doing it my way who was decending the tactics & team before especially after saying he takes full responsibility for picking wrong team against Sheffield United the guy is an absolute joke hasn't got a clue ü§°,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
He‚Äôs only got Carroll and big joe playing to head the ball away from the corners we will be facing,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Either a sneaky win or get thumped it‚Äôs what we have been crying on about 442 so here we go ...we will get thumped and Bruce will say see that‚Äôs what happens when we don‚Äôt setup the way we should,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Looks like he‚Äôs giving the fans what they want, if you lose, go down swinging and be entertaining and exciting to watch. Very top-heavy that. Excited to see if we give it a go",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Lose or win. Arsenal are a good side. As long as the players are consistently working hard on the pitch.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
So we're defensive against a team we needed to attack and now we're attacking against a team we need to defend against. Looks like we're going to get overrun in midfield.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Would of started Ritchie ahead of Joelinton, but glad we have finally got two up front should of happened a while ago though!",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
What's going on 5 at the back against the blades were we should of had a chance then against the Gunners were going 3 upfront..Yup clueless,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Carroll will sit in defence like he does every game so wilson will be upfront by himself while joelintion runs around like a headless chicken so its still 5 4 1,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
I dont think much will change tonight lascelles terrible joelington terrible and shelvey no ambition no natural instinct anymore just taking the coin,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"It's an improvement, I personally would have liked to seen Murphy on the right, miggy Centre mid instead of Carroll and Hayden for shelvey holding in the midfield to allow us to control the game but I'll take it over 5 defenders anyday!",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Quite an offensive line up from Bruce. Is this a line up to win the game or a line up to justify his usual defensive methods?,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Sheff United we play defensive...ars
enal got an average team out whats happening?",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
That'll do let's just have a go at arsenal and see what happens at least we're not full of defenders this time,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Sounds like it's the last throw of the dice to me
But let's see rather try and fail than fail to try..",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Not 5 at the back??! The gloves are really off!,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
I think because of covid19 I think joelinton should work from home.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Can‚Äôt complain it‚Äôs much more positive than it‚Äôs been,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"How does Joelinton keep getting a game.

Looking forward to Championship football next season",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Doesn't matter who plays, I wont be watching. January is depressing enough on it's own.",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"lewis and shelvey done nowt to warrant a place in starting 11, hayden should be there",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"If the team tries, then I don't care if we lose 2-0.",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Don't understand some comments. Shelvey is by far the best midfielder we have on our books.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
"Would have Hayden over Shelvey, but that looks a better fit. A bit more of attacking setup than we‚Äôve seen recently",181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
More attack minded players. This is the team he should have played against the blades.,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
You think he‚Äôs been on Facebook and seen who we‚Äôd pick then if it goes wrong it give him another excuse?,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Looks like I'll be watching a film tonight,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Still going to lose no matter what the line up,181,Arsenal,Newcastle,Away,3
Let's face it Tierney is an injury prone! He can't keep on playing match after match. We should get a first LB instead! Let Tierney be the 2nd choice. But what happened to Saka?! Our best players missing in a wrong a time really! Mysterious injury at it again! #COYG!,201,Arsenal,Man Utd,Home,0

Big chance for Martinelli to step up and prove his fitness and importance in the big games though in Saka's place.

Saka is a big miss as well üò≠

My only issue with the squad is the combo of eleny and xhaka. These guys can pass to goalkeepers 100 times. Pls warn them we have lost to the citizens courtesy of back pass in the past. We cant afford to do that now. Pls minimise back pass ooooo,241,Arsenal,Man City,Home,-1
Not a strong back 6! Didn‚Äôt expect anything from this game. City dominated and played within themselves. Still miles behind. But we keep believe. We have to. Only positive tierney back,241,Arsenal,Man City,Home,-1
Oh no.. not a good line up.. cant be xhaka n elneny together all ball will go to baseline.. i hope they push up their than rather pass back .. if not we r done for e three n 1 upfront attacker.. no build up play.. i hooe they can defend well wish for e best.. pray gooners if draw the best we could do.

"Interesting. Happy to see Mari back, but not sure this is the match I would return him to the starting lineup for, surely Gabriel would‚Äôve made more sense?

"City going for it with that line up. Looks like we'll be playing a very low block in front of the defence and try and play on the counter. Don't suspect we'll see a lot of the ball.

As much as he's been our best player this season surely today was the day to rest Saka? Plenty pace up top anyway.",241,Arsenal,Man City,Home,-1
It was natural that we‚Äôd rest & rotate players against City with this being the 2nd of 4 big games in 10 days. Everyone is writing us off today but we have the added incentive again of overtaking those fading Spuds too! #COYG,241,Arsenal,Man City,Home,-1
"City to win 3-0 with this line up. Ceballos was the best player mid week and yet still finds himself behind elneny utterly ridiculous. No pace or forward passing in that midfield 2 city are gonna love that with their midfield. No mobility in elneny and Xhaka. Laca again on the bench which City will love as he gives them a different problem, they'll handle Auba easily. Stupid line up. Just throw the towel in now saves you playing the game. I do like the CB pairing though. They were great together before Mari got injured. So glad I ain't watching it saves me a lot of misery and anger.",241,Arsenal,Man City,Home,-1
"For me personally this is the best line up given the current squad just just Partey who should replace Elneny is not fit.

"Only changes I would have made was Ceballos for Elneny as his passing range through the lines is the best in our XI

This lack of consistency in Arteta line ups especially the back 4 and the middle field will be his downfall... otherwise this is comfortable win for city. No offence gunners,241,Arsenal,Man City,Home,-1
Having a laugh...... so negative! Trying to keep it 0-0 and Nick a goal! Elneny and Xhaka with Pepe! Why don‚Äôt we play to try and win. Not much creativity here.

The only thing is Martinelli should be starting instead of pepe and we can have a good chance. Good luck coyg,241,Arsenal,Man City,Home,-1
Cedric not on the right means all the attack is going to flow down the left. Man City will plug that area and that's the end of all our chances. And the few on the right is going to be 50-50. It can work or it can be the source of all our misfortunes. El Neny I hope he passes the ball forward instead of sideways and backwards and moves the ball faster. Because Man City are going to press real hard and the central pairing of Xhaka and Neny are not the dribble masters who can get out sticky situations.,241,Arsenal,Man City,Home,-1
Definitely more of a balanced mindset between attacking and defending against city. Elneny and Xhaka will need to have a career of a game if we stand any chance at even keeping this game close. Clog up the midfield and not allow City offense to be free flowing,241,Arsenal,Man City,Home,-1

He always passes the ball backward, commits needless fouls, and goes to the floor too easily for a holding midfielder.

"You know you have nothing to lose.
Why not give the opportunity to balogun and Ayeez .
Ceballos is leaving us what‚Äôs the point of playing him knowing how much he has disappoint you.

It‚Äôs very clear you‚Äôre playing these lads to protect your job because you‚Äôre too afraid to go for the gun but instead focusing on your ‚Äúshape of the play‚Äù which has no progression because any further games lost will definitely put heavy pressure on your job and that clearly shows your intention here.",341,Arsenal,West Brom,Home,2

What‚Äôs with playing people out of position? Cedric is a full back proven that he can cover left back (criminal that as a club we only have one left back). Willian needs to show exactly why he was given such a long contract!

I said it...Arsenal is an experimental team. Teams like Chelsea. City. United are playing for the badge. This team plays for money for themselves and kroenke. WE ARE TIRED. Let‚Äôs all as fans abandon this club and move on with our lives.,341,Arsenal,West Brom,Home,2

I still trust the process anyway. But some of the players too should be committed everytime is not always the fault of the coach. The season was over the moment we lost our FA cup match.

"Arteta is going to stay. We can rant about it but seems like he is staying at least in the near future. Some players need to be discarded. But what Arsenal really need is a captain who commands respect from the other team members. They don't have one. And when they play the way they have been there is no one on the pitch to take control, rant and shout and get the guys going. Also make some hard tackles .Right now it looks like a super friendly team. There is no fighting spirit. They lose, have long faces and the next day they are smiling and laughing. They don't seem to be hurt by their own display. I remember Viera and the way he would shout or play or even more recently, Mertesacker the way he screamed at Ozil when he was walking away. Arsenal desperately need a leader who the others are scared of if they don't play good. The one I see with those qualities is Kieran Tierney. The others are not strong- they are like ' coffee with milk'. Just my amateur thoughts.",341,Arsenal,West Brom,Home,2

A manager that has no first eleven all season doesn't know what he wants and definitely not a good manager.

Obviously Saka, Smith-Rowe, and Tierney are the spine of our team. Elneny has always been good for us, why he isn't given the respect he deserves is beyond me",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"All the best lads in our last match. Let Everton lose, Tottenham lose but our Arsenal the best team in the world win. When this prayer manifests we shall take position 7....",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Seriously what do Martinelli and Elneny have to do to deserve a start! But, let‚Äôs end the season with a 5 game league winning run! Pepe deserved the start hopefully we see more of this consistent form next season! Not the greatest season but this game is important for next . GOYG",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
We need to win but also Everton to win..We deserve not to play in Europe.. Arsenal might get a better spot next season....,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Thank god this shambles of a season is over.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Come on gunners man c and leicester already did us a favour.. now all u guys need to do is to win this game!!,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Load of bullocks useless coach will be sack september next season without a don't side ways back ways football hard to watch i don't even know how the last part of season went because i stop watching from we were losing record games in a row especially at home and the clown didn't get sack . Arteta type of football kill Claude on Aftv.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
I really hope this is Arteta‚Äôs last game in charge,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Arteta, Arteta Arteta,You're human and you can't always be right on everything, consider the advice given to you by we the fans, concerning players like Martineli whom you love benching without any good reason!!",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Hopefully it's Arteta's last game in charge,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"It's Show Time at Emirates for the Last Session Before another Stressful Transfer speculation Window.

I go Into the Game As A #KroenkeOut",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"People always moaning, I mean I get it's been a shite season but a little perspective goes a long way.
* since boxing day only city have picked up more point's then us.
* We have the 3rd best defensive record.
* We could still end up in Europe.
* Saka, KT, ESR, martinelli , have been excellent.
* Partey has shown glimpses and will be better next year.
* Nico has been much better.
* Gabriel looks like he'll be an excellent CB I know he's been a bit off last few months but he's had injuries and been in and out of the team, people forget her was are best player until about December.
"" Auba surely can't be worse next season.
* We've actually not been horrendous against the other "" big teams'

See it's not all all doom and gloom üëç",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"4 wins in a row, Elneny started all of em but Arteta rewards him with the bench. Martinelli comes off the bench to win us the last game, still can't get in the starting 11. I really don't see anything special with this manager.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
I don‚Äôt know what Martinelli has to do to earn a start in this team. This is insane. Auba has been invisible throughout the season and yet he gets to start every game.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Where did Martinelli went wrong? I think he is the best option as CF for now. Anyway Good luck boys,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Guys, we can quality for europe league. Since Leichester won Fa cup, it means 6 and 7 place will Get europe league.

That means that Everton and Spurs has to loose points today.

Also, we can get europe league if:
Chelsea comes 5th and win the Champions league, then 7th place will get europe league.

Good possibilities tonight, since everton play city and Spurs play leichester",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
If all goes well then we can finish at number 7. Which is a good given the faulty start,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Apparently, there is no rhyme or rhythm to Arteta's team selection. He relies solely on serendipity. Sums up our season. Good luck lads!",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
We should not qualify for that Europa League Conference. It's better to rebuild next season without European duties,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Why does this guy bench in form players? Elneny deserves his place ahead of Xhaka imo. This manager is a joke. Long season next year with him in charge, whether he get his players or not.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Why use nketia when he will be sold.. Get balogun on the bench for the experience and a sneek peek of things to come Lacazette is on the bench anyway if we desperately need to change things.. But if we are winning and 10 mins left etc get balogun on.. Should have bring Azeez in too,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Imagine next season playing with the same player's and the same clueless coach,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Let's pray for Tottenham and Everton not to win so that we can qualify for Europa conference Leagu ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
How Martinelli isn't starting this game is beyond me.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Martinelli on the bench again!! Am tired with this coach.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
All the best football jokers. I have never seen Arsenal like this before. But you will be in my history book where I will use this Arsenal as reference whenever we fail again.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Again Elneny in the sups means you will loose or draw at max .,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
put Runarsson in if we want to lose this one!,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
I still dont understand why we not playing 3 Strikers at the same time.. Laca..Gabbi and Auba..... Anyway.. Lets finish strong‚ù§Ô∏è,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"So even in the last game of the season where we don't really play for anything anymore, he's still not using Balogun & Azeez? Surely they aren't any worse than Ceballos & Nketiah....",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Auba got to play regardless of form, with this kind of mentality from the coach, we can‚Äôt even go far in the conference league. Will be a new season same mentality. Got to be ruthless to dominate premierleague",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Experimenting till the very last game. Martinelli and Saka are our delicate future (next season) ready stars yes! But could have been handed first choice in this last game too. We want nothing but straight win without compromising.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Odegaard starts! Martinelli on the bench! Arteta still don‚Äôt know his best starting 11... üòè,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Today we're winning, the line-up is perfect. We can't have everyone in the team in the first X1.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"If we score a million goals today, what difference does it make?

What are we playing for today?

Another season of disappointment.
And to imagine we started the season on a high. Too much expectations, now what?",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Odegaard and Smith Rowe playing together never works ffs. When will this coach learn??,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Elneny must be the most humble footballer ever. Never complains even when treated unfairly,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"almost the same starting11
as the last game.
First time this season and it happens in game 38.
Most remarkable.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Martinelli should ask for a transfer what has Arteta got against this young man üë®,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
All the best guys as we hope Man City and Leicester does it for us on the other ends,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
What more does martinelli have to do to get regular game time?? Why is Arteta is happy to play loanees over youth when they wont be here next season?!,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
We failed this season because our manager doesn‚Äôt know his best 11,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Auba starting again..... should be martinelli instead of auba.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Sack Arteta & bring in all the managers commenting. Seems like they are experts compared to the manager. Then again, how is Kroenke to pay for so many managers at a time? #KroenkeOut for not getting all these managers on lead Arsenal.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Seriously what martinelli have to do more to get a start??,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Why is Aubameyang starting matches???, This 10 man vs 11 man,Having Aubameyang inside starting XI is like having red card.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
I will count how many back pass below average xhaka have in this game.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Martinelli makes more of an impact from the bench than as a starter so ion know why some of yall moaning.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Xhaka can't put elneny on the bench. Laca is better than Auba. Martineli on the left could make more sense,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
This is how Arsenal goes starts on bad formation but finishes on a better one congratulation brothers.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
With this lineup we can end up the season with a victory,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2

"Clean house next season only starters in that line up should be aubameyang smith Rowe partey tierney...let‚Äôs

hope pepe hatrick goal .and odergard hatrick assist .and smith rowe make many created on midfield .tonight mission must win .and hope leicester city and manchester city help a team tonight in the god name.amenn ..,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Do we need to play Odegard though, I mean he's on his way out, why not give minutes to our own players ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"It is always Arteta's lineups that shows how tactically unsound he is. When last did Auba score a goal ? Gabriel makes too much errors and you have Mari on the bench? Odegard is going back to Real Madrid, why not use Lacazette ?Arsenal does not need new players as a priority, it is the manager that makes the players redundant !",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"If spurs loose and Everton draw, while we win there might just be hope for Europa again right?ü§î",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"What does Martinelli have to do to start a game? When last did he even have a bad game? As long as he is fit, he should always start games.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Martinelli absent again .... I don't know what to say anymore ...any way all the best let's win it,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
F@cking lived with arsenal messing around in the half way line could not even bother to walk around and applaud the fans first time in many years that this has happened total disgusted with you arteta and players,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"With this change in lineups in every game,arsenal won't go anywhere with Arteta,its this change in lineups that brings inconsistencies",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Arteta what did Martinelli and Lacazette do to you?,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Even after almost a year and a half,
Arteta cant find the right XI
Martinelli on the bench while he keeps winning matches for the team

4 wins in a row when El Neny starts but he prefers Xhaka

If Elneny changes his name to Lopez he may starts every game! Or go away and comes back to Arsenal for 50 odd millions! What Partey and Odegard can do that he can not???he scored more goals than Partey who is on 250k a week!,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"At the beginning of the season, I set 75 points as my gunner's target, in the end it was 61, not too bad considering that the difference btw fourth and 8th is only two wins or less.
Weldome guys.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2

Praying that the season goes with the shambolic and disastrous manager in ARTETA.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Yet again abua starting he has no impact y is laca not starting or martinelli another reason this manager shouldn‚Äôt be at Arsenal,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Whats hard in playing Smith Rowe as no10 instead of √òdegaard and start Martinelli??
Even if we win today, This manager is wack. Aubameyang has been trash this season and he still starts ahead of Lacazette who has been our top scorer this season.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"No Saka, No Martinelli, No Elneny??? Arteta is really not making anyone enthusiastic about him staying as manager with these choices!",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
The chance is slim but real for Arsenal to make it to Europa league! Good luck Gunners!,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"The problem with arteta is that he normally copy other coaches formation like that of man city and Chelsea, look at what he did against Villarreal he only used midfielders just like man city did to psg he should be knowing that man city and arsenal players are not of the same level",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Lacazette out of arteta plans, no start for lacca our top scorer",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Martinelli has earned a starting place yet again isn‚Äôt picked üôÑ,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Martinelli on the bench?
Arteta is a joke, you also keep lacazette as if you have a champions league final to play",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
It has to be Pepe not Saka now Mikel can see it when pepe play on the rightwing he is so good,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"But this Arteta, why can't he give martinelli a place.
Even when Saka is out he still put him out and u bring u'r boy odegaard",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"I'm happy with this selection, also we have a good looking bench to save us if need be üòé",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
This nonsense of fielding Holding and Chambers should stop. The better thing to do is have them both leave the club to avoid the temptation of ever fielding them,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Arteta and he's tactics are nothing to be surprised, if the players play well the following game in benchü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, why changing a team who won last 4 gamesü§î, even if he will get the best team in world, he still will manage to mess around, Arteta he's like a bad driver who drive a Ferrari.ü§Ø",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Elneney should be the first line up ahead of poor and sloppy Xhaka!,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Am eager for odegard to leave, i just want to see Smith-rowe in that position week in week out",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Arteta Forgotten..the impact of Lacazzette in the last meeting with Brighton n now Benched him ....Saka on the bench üê©..it was Saka n Lacazzette that bought the goals. .. now both are on the bench maybe until they concede a goal before he will make changes...n we all know the rest,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Keyboard coaches out in force for last game of season with there negative comments hopefully they won't be in the group for next season as should only be for real fans not fake fans,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
the is Effect aubameyang in i don't now at that time,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Yet another stupid selection from a manager who doesn‚Äôt have a clue PLEASE Sack him NOW!!!! Before he takes us even further down and bores us to death,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Why not give the kids a run out surely we don‚Äôt want the conference,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
For the first in my life I don‚Äôt want Arsenal to win..can‚Äôt stand the conference league ting it‚Äôs a embarrassment for a big club like Arsenal.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
More important to know who's the last time for good?,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
martinelli has had 2 bad injuries arteta knows wat he is doin the kid is still developing he will get game time nxt season hes future star,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
I guess Arteta is More of Everton legend than arsenal clueless manager,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
With this team. We might end up at 10 position next season. Mediocre X11,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Arteta is a joke,why did him bring Cedric from Southampton, yet can't give him a playing time,chamber's for me is a good player,but Cedric for me should be playing ahead of him, he wanna bring in Bertrand as well,this lad is just turning this club to a dumping zone,we have got Kolasinac,still
prefer him to Bertrand,cant believe Auba is picked ahead of laca and Martinelli,this
club is finish with Arteta in charge ,cleuesless gaffer.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Why? There isn't Lacca on starter, why? Don't be like that, Lacca is our top scores in club right now. So naive.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Partey must step up to the plate, his performances lately do not match his talents.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Why Laca is being benched now when he was our best player before his injury? Or just because Arteta wants him out of the club!,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"Martenely, elnenny and saka benched in the final game last chance to Europe league is a first degree betrayal for arsenal",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Why does Matinelli not start. Auba does not score yet he gets to play. I really can't understand,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
The next coach should just look for ozil or cazorla look a likes,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Lacazette and martineli why are they always on the bench??,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Ffs. Why is Martinelli on the bench ! We going to be 1 or 2 nil down & Arteta is going to panic sub & bring on Martinelli and Saka.,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Pepe & Xhaka starting leaving Laca & Saka on the bench is what I call a JOKE,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Chambers should go elsewhere or else arteta will give him a chance which will cost arsenal,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
Stop starting odeegard with smith Rowe .... that‚Äôs what cost you that semi final ... emty head .....,371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2
"With a good transfer window, Arteta and the club will turn the corner next season.",371,Arsenal,Brighton,Home,2

"To be honest, I think Bruce now just throws the names of the fit players in a bag and pulls 10 out, then hopes for the best",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Two strikers but no one to cross a ball, it's official Steve you could pick your nose never mind the team. Good job Rafa is on a flight home as we speak!",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
How on earth is Shelvey getting a start after the embarrassment he put together against Arsenal? Doesn't deserve a go. Good to see Manquillo selected over that shower Krafth though.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Wilson out on the wing seems an odd choice to me. Just don‚Äôt rate Hendrick. Line up graphic shows Carroll up front one his own. Think we lose attacking force of Wilson out on the wing. Again seems like an odd line up,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"OK - it's not who I would have picked - but if it's not going well, let's make changes at half time before it's too late ! - there's plenty on the bench",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
How is Lewis in the lineup? Even air would be better üòî,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
If we lose tonight my kits are going to be hung in my closet waiting for another 10 years to roll around. Maybe by then we will have a new owner and a real coach.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Cmon! We got this!!! Glad Carroll is getting a game, delighted Joelinton is benched... Shelvey ffs... the bench looks relatively strong, Ritchie, Gayle, Fraser can turn the game given half a chance and welcome back ASM! #HWTL",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Haven't seen the Mags so adventurous for ages. Goal was a setback especially when Darlow could have done so much better but won't criticise him because of past performances. Keep the faith HTL,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
I know Lewis is still young but he must be one of the worst players we‚Äôve ever had and yes I‚Äôve followed NUFC for over 50 years,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
I‚Äôve genuinely no idea what formation that will be but I sincerely hope it won‚Äôt be a back three with Hayden in there; our best midfielder by some distance and real worries if it‚Äôs Hendrick and Shelvey in the middle of the park...And don‚Äôt get me started on the decision to play Carroll with no wingers. No consistency in shape or selection and feels like numbers out of a hat,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Disgrace how can lascelles and Lewis keep their places disgusting performance last time don‚Äôt even mention shelvey and hendrick what is this manager up to it‚Äôs mbarrisin,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Villa fan here, I come in peace üòÉüòÉ was just looking up your line up. Can honestly say from a Villa fans perspective, Bruce is clueless. Was exactly the same at Villa. U lot should go and get Rafa back üòÄ",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Nearly our best starting line up!
Would like to of seen Almiron on the right & Ritchie on the left.
Need a new RW quickly!!!",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Totally clueless again from Bruce! Great to see Carroll and Wilson start but as Super Mac said in the Chronicle, we need wingers on the pitch to put crosses in for them.",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Let‚Äôs play 2 strikers, no orthodox winger to cross the ball, Andy Carroll could win a header against anyone but Brucey knows best üòÇ hoping for a positive result but not holding my breath",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"If we loose. Or When we loose tonight, am done with em. They just look clueless. No desire for the ball. No attacking play. And Bruce, well he's just a shaft piece, with no ideas. üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
So plays Carroll he deserves to start but no wingers to cross in it for him great tactics again.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
At least jokelinton is benched would do the same to Shelvey after his last performance,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Great the laziest player to ever play in the premier league and worst corner and free kick taker ever to play in the premier league shelvey starts. I can‚Äôt stand him.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Good luck to everyone watching it, I've went with the Masked Singer - I'd rather watch that than see cabbage heed looking perplexed for 90 minutes.",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"If your playing Carroll up front surely you need wingers in the team, Murphy on the right and Ritchie on the left, HENDRICK and Almiron won‚Äôt get crosses in to get the most out of Carroll",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Lewis and lascelles cant defend this has calamity written all over it,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Hope that's a 433 rather than 442 as neither winger is going to cross to Carroll in that team.
Hendrick is not a winger!

Set up for a late influx from Saint max to try and make a difference when it'll probably be too late üòÇ",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Hendrick and shelvey üôàthe mind boggles either we sneak a draw or grealish rips us apart we shall see,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"We have 2 CBs fit and he plays with 3 ü§° Miggy out of position as per, Hendrick and Shelvey lazy and offer nothing, and why can't we just give Matty a run of games? 3-0 Villa",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Villa played well last time out against Man City Think it will be another sad night for us . Bruce out,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
I just dnt get bruce lyk why play Carroll upfront if you not got no wingers to cross the ball should be playing Ritchie nd Murphy bruce clueless bruce out,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Shelvey and Hendrick in midfield wow he is looking for the tic tac,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Shelvey and Hendrick will boss that midfield.... said Steve Bruce and no one else.
Carroll and no wingers.... quicker we get this new coach the better üòÇ",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
How the hell Hendrick and Shelvey get in ahead of Matt longstaff is just beyond me it really is but thank God hopelesslinton is not playing.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Lewis already made a mistake 50 seconds in and then once again took a throwing straight to villa why does he get a shirt,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Going for a loss again with that line up ffs....hendrick
s couldn't tie my boots and i can't play football",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Why Jeff Hendrick does he have compromising pictures of Bruce that he‚Äôs threatening to release if he doesn‚Äôt start him and shelvey have the mobility of a corpse,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
I think you got more chance of lockdown being lifted next week than Newcastle winning tonight.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Why isn‚Äôt Ritchie on from the start. He one of our better creative players,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"I‚Äôd have liked Ritchie starting on the left to help Lewis out, hendrick will help out manquillo like he did at West Ham.

Let‚Äôs hope for a result however a thrashing could spell the end for Bruce so I‚Äôm unsure what I want more üòÇ",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Watching this team is like watching Brazil...but only if the Brazil players are blindfolded and wearing wellies,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"No one to supply Carroll with crosses, villa are quiet weak in the air, so Carroll not gonna get the chances tonight, need Richie really??",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Playing with 11men tonight no Linton.. Positive sign,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"My only problem with this line up which also shows how clueless bruce is. Plays carrol who needs crosses but starts with no wingers on the pitch and then he will sub carrol and bring wingers on.
We have to get a win at some point so come on lads",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Absolutely as good as it gets at the moment. Glad his obsession with Joelinton has stopped. Who knows we may even have a shot at goal?,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Hendrick and shelvey starting, gloves are back on",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"To be fair that‚Äôs probably the best he can pick it‚Äôs not a negative line up and asm,Gayle,Frase
r and others good bench cmon the toon let‚Äôs av em ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Clueless cabbage head, best crosser of a ball on bench in Ritchie",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
The bench looks stronger than the starting 11 üòÇüòÇ,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Why is shelvey and Lewis starting. Been awful.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Hendeick over richie or Murphy!!! Wtf,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
How on earth does hendrick get in our team,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Why isn‚Äôt Joelinton starting?,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
With 30 to go he will bring Linton Ritchie Murphy or Fraser on and Carroll of as Linton is prolific in the air,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Ah yes Newcastle fans hoping for a villa win so they can abuse their manager. What a great way to support yr team.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Shelvey and Hendrick...... Bruce may as well stick Professor Hawking's and Superman in there and it'd be more mobile.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Theres no passion in the team and Bruce has lost the plot, so itsvus supporters that lose out yet again. Sad times",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
How is shelvey still getting a game? Jesus Christ man,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Losing is okay but losing it before it starts is a big problem. The team isnt playing for themselves and that is hurting.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
why dont he play 4 2 3 1. get carroll off fraser in. shelvey almiron fraser behind Wilson,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Another match another 11....

Playing big Andy up front is great if you give him service !",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"We NEED WINGERS Bruce, how is Carroll supposed to get any chances.",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
442 with no proper wingers to service Carroll to get the best out of him and Wilson.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
take a chance and stick richie out on the left .. abit service for carroll,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Saw Lee Hendrie on Stellings show 2day : The only media pal of Brucey to say it as it is like us alleged deluded :- Quoted its like watching paint dry :- too defensive :- plays attacking players behind the ball : bottom 3 very possible :- A Change needed : tonight 1st half as all above: Change is needed . The ‚ÄòMighty Rafa ‚Äò was organised : This guy ain‚Äôt,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Don't think he had a plan anymore think he is lost at what to do next unfortunately for the team,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Jeff Hendrick and shelvey. That midfield get overrun. Grealish going to have both socks full before kick off.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
We will be two down before Bruce realises that Hendrick is as useful as a chocolate teapot.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"No pace in midfield, and you are going to play Carroll you need to play someone who can cross a ball.",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
I would like to think it cant be any worse than the last match.... However this is Newcastle and the worst Newcastle team I have seen for a long long time. We have the players just a manager that is unable to play them anything but ultra defensive.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
3 5 2 doesn't look good for ALMIRON having to to be the play maker. With 2 holding players it's mad he's got two wing backs. So don't need 2 defencive mid field. Hope I'm wrong should've went 4 3 3,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"I think. This, team has a slightly better look to it than the arsenal, game, but still not to positive,",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"In fairness to Bruce, other than Hendrick, this is probably the best he has available to him. Obviously Shelvey needs to be much, much, much better than his last game but when he wants to he can actually play.",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Where is the width? Who is gonna cross a ball into the box? Carroll and Wilson rely on width.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Logic again from cabbage heed, 2 big men up top and nobody able of putting a decent cross in starting",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
I dont think shelvey is fit.hes the only quality midfielder who can pass forward we have but your right hes playing terrible,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Doesn't matter if we had Messi, Ronaldo and Mbappe as forwards. With Bruce managing them he'd have them all playing as defensive midfielders #bruceout",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
2 up front and all 2 of them will be in there own half running after the ball. Villa will control the ball Newcastle will sit back normal night,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
It‚Äôs funny how people are slagging Hendrix . He‚Äôs got 2 goals from open play cost nowt and used as a sub . Wilson has 3 from open play cost ¬£20m and not missed a single minute of football . Just saying,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
I have had it now with bruce for gods sake shelvey and hendrick should be no where near a premier team,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Might as well put Darlow n Dubravka on the wing , at least they can throw in a bit further and maybe beat the first man !!!! Lol üòÇ",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
We are going to owned in that midfield. This isn‚Äôt going to be pretty.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
And so the torture begins. Be afraid be very afraid. Remember that 6-0 we had.....well revenge is sweet!!,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Carroll in the team and no one who can cross a ball,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Echo what others are saying about the midfield. You got Carroll up front and Fraser on the bench who can provide assists!! If you are going to play 442 you need legs in midfield and wingers! Only Almiron thats nowhere near enough!! Gayles better than Carroll and mobile.

Personally I'd go 451

Darlow
Manquillo
Schar
Lascelles
Lewis
Alimiron (RM)
Matty (RC)
Shelvey (Centre)
Ritchie (LC)
Fraser (LW)
Wilson

Then use ASM, Gayle as fresh legs on the wings last 20 (or go 442 last 20 with Gayle up top if its level pegs) and bring on another midfielder for fresh legs",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
We‚Äôre was the captain again missing for the goal,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Ritchie for Hendrick and Gayle for Carroll it‚Äôs effort and commitment we seem to lack and skill and confidence and tactics and the ability to put the ball in the net.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Got to be honest, I had more confidence in Cheltenham beating Man City.",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
I think I would take Hendricks out and put in Murphy or Richie think they are a better choice,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Don't care! The players picked are irrelevant when we have such an incompetent manager!,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Expect the same old dross we've had the misfortune to witness of late. I'm not putting myself through it tonight.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Gloves are off, along with hats and any sort of thought that goes into picking a team with 2 strikers up top and no wingers to cross the ball to them.

Looking forward to 50 yard diagonals from shelvey to the goal keeper for 90 minutes",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
cant believe it joelinton not starting must have broken a finger nail,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Let's hope ASM gets half hour or more. Still too defensive. Good to see Manquillo though, he does run the link bed but Bruce won't let them lash crosses in I feel.",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Big Joe not starting...üòÆüòù Why won't he start Murphy, man?",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Yet again no wingers or crossers in the starting 11 but Fraser Murphy Richie and ASM on bench. Shelvey and Hendrick üôà dear god. All our creativity on bench. Long game and nick a goal late on,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Is that 442 again with no wingers for the two strikers? Why does he persist with Hendrick as a right winger when he isn't even a winger.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
at least hes dropped the longstaff nuggets,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Seriously Carroll up front on his own? More defensive boredom to come then we go a goal down and subs come on and we open up - not sure I can watch!,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
At least jokelinton isn't starting that has to be positive ü§îüòâ but what has murphy to do to get a start ??,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Hope it's a 4312 and not hendricks on the right wing when we've got Murphy n fraser on the bench üôÑ,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Doesn‚Äôt matter how we line up, still gonna park the bus and play with 30% possesion",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"How the hell does Lewis play ahead of Ritchie, and Hendrick instead of Fraser or Murphy?",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Carroll starting and people talking about no wingers, how about Carroll actually make sure he's in the box to win any headers rather than be alongside our midfield...",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Anderson been took out the team with out getting a chance when he's looked tidy in the last 10 mins against arsenal he should have hendricks place all day long,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Shelvey should never wear the black and white shirt again.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
If shelvey got game head wir youngin id take him out the school under 9s,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Why is it that our bench always looks more attacking than the starting 11,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Another game with no one to supply the front two.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Defensive team again. What‚Äôs the point, not even going to watch it. ü§°",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
hendrick Carroll and shelvey should be benched .. picked the wrong team yet again,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Can't wait to hear what the cabbage headed thunderc#nt has to rant about pre and post match.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Oh for crying out loud Newcastle, where are our famous Black and White striped shirts? No colour clash there!",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Hendricks on the wing fuking clueless .. richie .murphy and fraser all wingers .. Hendricks centre midfield. Deserve what you get bruce,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Drop Carroll for Gayle and play him up front with Wilson!! Also why is Hendrick on the field instead of Richie?!!,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Why oh why can't he start in my opinion our best 2 strikers in Wilson and Gayle together?,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Is Hendrick riding one of Bruce‚Äôs family ?,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Going to be all villa that lineup just says I have no idea anymore!,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Wilson and Carroll no wingers Murphy on the bench they don‚Äôt come any thicker than Bruce he just doesn‚Äôt learn,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
I reckon the bench could beat the first team,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Ritchie and Murphy must wonder how they can‚Äôt get a game on the wing but Hendrick can. That‚Äôs 4-4-2 that team.,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
"Why the bloody hell is Jeff Hendrick at right mid? We have joelinton, Fraser, Murphy Gayle..... Jesus Christ",101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Had a rubbish nights sleep last night. This should be good enough to put me to sleep for 90 mins!,101,Aston Villa,Newcastle,Away,2
Thank God Mat Ryan is fit and available üôà,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
"I must admit I don‚Äôt know much about our keeper situation going on. Somebody please enlighten me and what do we want/
expect, I‚Äôm scared......... is there hope?",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
I don‚Äôt understand how players like Martineli and Tierney get injured! They always get injured in trainings! Maybe they should start boycotting trainings üò§üò§,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Question through; how are Luiz and Leno only serving one match bans for their straight reds? I thought it was 3 games for straight reds?,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1

"I really hope good judgement by the referee, then we will win for sure",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
"I hope Ryan will be fit for that game. That Rurna...gona give me heart attack if he starts.,he's a future great keeper maybe.",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Opportunity for us to see the quality of Runason.... Good for Gabriel to play and regain his form. This guy literally carried the team late last year when everyone was struggling and I hate to see him on the bench!,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Good news Matty Ryan and Mari available. If we can capture the form of the first 45 mins against wolves then we'll take care of villa and most teams for that matter!,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
"My Line up Saturday
Leno ( Ryan)
Bellerin
Cedric
Holding
Gabriel
Xhaka
Partey
Saka
S Rowe
Pepe
Aubameyang

Ps would love to have lacazette in he's been playing well, but I believe aub will be prolific again",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
This mari should return Asap! We miss him a lot. Very organized and tidy center back.,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
"Pablo Mari comes straight back in for me, his fit now and ready to return. His partnership with Holding was growing very nicely.",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
"I saw ""Team News"" and my heart sunk a bit üôÉ
Thought it was the lineup that was released.
I hate missing Arsenal match ü§™üòÜ",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
"He's got an excellent team to contend with, but who knows, Arsenal has got that mentality of bottling games when you least expected them to win. So fingers crossed for now.",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
"Ryan in goal for me.

The team is really missing Tierney.

Good luck tomorrow guys.",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
"Once there's Pablo, it is a sure win. I know he never had any injury. The board knows what they have been avoiding. Luiz' suspension has forced them to do the right thing.
Goodluck Pablo!",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Now feeling positive..mat Ryan between the two sticks and combination of Mari & Holdings will be a confortable win for gunners,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
"At the end, its d same result... Best way to watch arsenal match?!... Don't expect win from them...",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Wish kt was available we miss his runs forward and his final ball something shocking.....,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Why is it the best players are getting injured a lot but the useless ones are fine,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Love Mari and thank god we have Matty Ryan for goal üòÖ wish Tierney wasn‚Äôt injured so much!,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
And don't forget that our beloved manager has been nominated as a best manager of January.....so let's keep the fire burning Gunners,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
"Do not drop pepe to try and fit auba back in, he needs to earn his spot by good sub appearances. As much as I like gabriel I think I'd start Mari for this game as we need discipline against villa",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Looking forward to seeing mat Ryan and for me Mari has to come back in he was superb before been injured,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Pepe must start again. His performances have improved and we are getting value for money on his 72 million. His value is also not dropping to zero as before,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
My guy Mari calm and composed on da ball should definitely start ahead of Gabrielüëàüèæ,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
We have never lost any game that Mari played so happy for u backs pabro,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
What's happening to Tierney? Discomfort in the right leg for over a month? This sounds more serious than the club is letting on.,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Hope the selection will be good for the game as well as featuring of the players,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1

Worried about Tierney. Too important and he is having so many injuries,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1
Pepe is playing nothing . he was just lucky to have scored in the last 2 matches . he lacks confidence in himself . No ball control . No pass accuracy .,221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1

"Arteta should better start playing Odegaard before he turns him into Suarez. In terms of skills, experience, strength etc, Odegaard is better than Smith. Smith still has a lot to learn.",221,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Away,1

"I can‚Äôt get my head around Murphy not starting. He makes so much of a difference when he comes on the pitch. Hopefully he‚Äôll bring him on and get some decent game time, but he does deserve to be in the starting 11 in my opinion.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Glad Miggy is back but Carroll, Ritchie & Murphy should be starting. What's Slowlinton gonna do? A relegation match, and we continue playing a ¬£40M flop. Can only see a Brighton win. They did well against Southampton.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Good to see Almiron back - not so good to see Joelinton on the pitch - another opportunity lost, I fear...",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"We are in a dog fight, need players with a bit about them on the pitch, Carrol and Ritchie should be starting",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"What has Andy Carroll got to do to get a start. Especially against a defence like Brighton who look quite tall and physical. Not forgetting Joelinton couldn‚Äôt hit a barn door if he was sat on the handle! üôà. One positive, having Miggy back. Such a big game, I hope they‚Äôre up for this. Howay the Lads! ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"This is probably our best lineup, apart from Wilson and Saint-Maximin missing. I just hope Carroll gets throw in earlier if Joelinton doesn‚Äôt get off to a good start.

We‚Äôve got an excellent centre-back squad, so no worries who slots in next to Lascelles. I also think that‚Äôs our best Fullback pairing to start a match. Allows Jamal Lewis to come on fresh, which is the best scenario for him since he‚Äôs more attacking minded.

Come on the boys! ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Joelinton definitely has an always start clause in his contract like! Huge risk rushing Almiron back! Why aren't we giving Murphy a chance.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"I really wanted Bruce to succeed at Utd but his failure to see what everyone else can that joelinton is a total liability, he stubbornly refuses to change and will bring us relegation.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Thought Carroll would have been useful today against a tall Brighton defense. But unreal to see Miggy back, just what we needed! Come on boys ‚ö´‚ö™",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
It looks a better side already with miggy in the line up. Glad krafth has been dropped but would of loved Murphy to of started tonight. If we can get 3 points it would be great!! Wilson & ASM hopefully to return soon too HTL ‚óºÔ∏è‚óªÔ∏è,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Happy with that. Dummett and manq have been sorely missed. Shows the state of affairs sadly.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
I can't believe joelinton is in again surely Carroll would have been a better bet with Almiron and fraser playing off him but what do us supporters know,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Hope Miggy hasn‚Äôt been rushed back too soon. Don‚Äôt expect him to be on for the full 90. Also, got wrong Longstaff on bench.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Get in Miguel Almiron Son glad he is Back fit and fresh from Injury along with Javier Manquillo in our One and Only Mighty Toon Army‚Äôs Starting 11 to Face Brighton and Hove Albion Away at the Amex Stadium 8PM Tonight for our Massive Must Win Game and Reckon we will Take all Three Points Back to the Toon HWTL Forever And Always UP The Mighty Mags For Life

What does Murphy have to do to get a start? Amazing to see Miggy back but hope it isn't rushed and he gets injured again. HWTL !,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Maybe Murphy for Fraser but best team he could pick. Defence looks good. Hope Miggy is ready,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Worst performance from Newcastle I can ever remember. None of that team are good enough to wear the shirt. This is a relegation fight FFS. Pathetic is an understatement.
I could put 11 lads together who would play for Newcastle for free who would do better than that. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Get out of our club the lot you.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"No striker again.....and bruces immense player jokelinton gives us all hope.........th
ank god for alcohol",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"So when Joelinton gets his chances this week Bruce is expecting him to put them away is he? What‚Äôs changed?
Murphy and Carrol will be fuming.
Unbelievable",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
So Steve Bruce thinks it‚Äôs ok to go into a must win game without a striker on the pitch. Beyond words!,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Surely any of those outfield substitutes is more deserving of a start than Joelinton. First job of whoever takes over is find out who sanctioned that move - and fee - and boot them out of the club.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Everyone going on about miggy, yes he works hard every game, but what can he do on his own up front? Not getting a decent service and he's always expected to carry the ball a long distance. He'd do well with better players... Or better management of the team!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
What has joelinton got to not do before he does not start. Manquillo and dummet are shocking. How does Murphy not start and why not give Carroll a go from start. Least he‚Äôll try and bring spake passion unlike joelinton. We NEED to win this. I fear the worse,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Carroll,Richie & Murphy on the bench again in a game where leaders and passion is needed ü§Ø
Where is the now coach and boyhood support that has stood on the Gallowgate as a lad that wants the club to move forward and play in an attacking way.
O i forgot he is sitting behind Steve Bruce üò°",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Is Bruce trying to get us relegated!! We need goals and he has 2 strikers on the bench. He blindly continues with options that gives us very little up top. Carroll and Murphy should have started. Sick of this week after week.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Shelvey has definitely been doing some toe sucking to keep his place, the blokes a disgrace",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Not the line up I would of gone with I would of started Murphy and Carroll and Ritchie but pleased Almiron is back, such a big game and this is a must WIN game!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"It‚Äôs good enough to beat Brighton, or should be anyway. Bruce tactics makes nothing certain",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Hope big Joe continues his excellent run of form of late and gets a goal to top it off. Murphy needs 30 minutes tonight or from whenever Miggy runs out of steam,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"4 minutes in and predictable already. No attacking threat. Weak at the back. Zero connection throughout the team.
I hope this comment comes back to haunt me, however I very much doubt it.

BRUCE OUT! HOWE IN!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Joe Linton in the team again, obviously gonna use his pace and heading prowess in the box. Why oh why does he get a game? Once Bruce gets sacked it has to come out, Ashley must be telling him to play him.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Only change I‚Äôd have done Murphy for Fraser but glad Manquillo‚Äôs back missed him massively,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Glad to see miggy back. Was hoping Murphy would get a start. Must win. Hwtl,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Should have started with Carroll and Murphy but pleased to see Miggy back. Joelinton will not score again. Needs sold in the summer,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
I‚Äôve watched the toon for 55 years and I can honestly say I‚Äôve never seen a player as bad as joelinton . Yes some have come very close but not as bad considering the price tag . What the hell is going on .,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Hope Almiron isn't being rushed back to soon. Would have liked to see Murphy given a start as think he has done decent when coming on as sub recently. Wonder if Carroll will get more than 1 minute tonight ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Murphy and Carrol should be in there from the start,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Not a bad team at all and as long as Murphy gets half an hour I‚Äôd be gappy,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Nice to see Almiron and Manquilo back starting but disappointed not to see Murphy given a start over Fraser. Continuing to play Joelinton in number 9 role is going to result in another game we struggle to score.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Apart from shelvey I quite like that line up can see us getting a W,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Why persist with joelinton we needs goals and he ain‚Äôt a goalscorer,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
I‚Äôve literally no idea why Joelinton is constantly in this side. It‚Äôs honestly as though they want us relegated on purpose,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
He had to start with Carroll n Murphy tonight like. Brighton 2nd worst record in the league defending set pieces,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Murphy must be hiding Bruce's pasties! He should be in,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Glad almiron is back, how Murphy doesn‚Äôt get a start is beyond me! And surely Matt Richie should start, in my opinion the left back spot should be his!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
What has Murphy got to do to get a start!,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
tonight's the night I'm a millionaire put a 5a on linton hatrick,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Joelinton starts. Madness. He does absolutely nothing,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Murphy motm last game and played 15mins, is that stupid t--t reet in the heedüò†",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Better but why joelinton start either Carroll or Gayle,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Glad to see miggy back! Biggest game of the season so far and no striker on the pitch ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Almiron back is massive, our best player by a mile. I can see a few goals for him tonight!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Good defensive line up I know dummet or Clark rarely try to get up field but they are solid and do their jobs well,hopefully the rest will do their jobs too with miggy back might breathe some confidence in the rest cmon the toon ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Every game we play the other team always plays better and is on the front foot. We seem scared and trying not to lose a goal rather than scoring a goal,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Considering this is a must win game, this team doesn‚Äôt exactly fill me with hope!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Why is lascelles playing he is awful twice now he was caught out in wrong position we have only played 7 mins when are we going to learn the man is an absolute waster of defender üò©üò©,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
What‚Äôs Murphy gotta do fml. Hendrick starting is a disgrace. Only time you know he‚Äôs been on is when he gets subbed off,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Joelinton off for caroll. It's not like we play champagne football so might as well have him up there causing trouble. The man needs a stint in the U23s for his confidence and no I'm not joking!,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Play Gayle, why stick with Joelinton?! It's not going to happen Bruce give up already, 4 4 2 with Carroll and Gayle and go for it.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"If Steve Bruce aka cabbage heed is reading this. F@##king he'll you need Steve Barnes, not Steve Bruce today. A striker indeed.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
This game is already lost. NU not trying to win just trying to stop Brighton from winning. Disgraceful.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Give carol a go, he will give his all, even if he gives 80%its still better than jolinton, cut your loss on him, think of the club, and if your not starting mat ritchie, you deserve the name clown and cabbage",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Everyone is hating on Bruce yeah he is to blame massively but what are the ""team"" playing at what happened to the team who had heart and left everything on the pitch. How many times do we need to do this before we realise what it's doing to the club. We will be playing Gateshead in no time.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Steve Bruce in the last chance saloon. Totally devoid of ideas,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Pathetic result. This squad should be seeing him better results. If only we had a prominent manager that could get the best out of them... ü§î oh wait...,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
I would have started Murphy over joe and maybe longstaff over johnjo but miggy is a positive sign,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Hope Miggy is actually fit rather than being thrown in out of desperation. Joelinton and Fraser should have been dropped for Murphy and Gayle/Carroll but as we have seen Joelinton is indispensable. I mean how would we manage without his 3 goals in over 60 games?,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
This is a 6 pointer. Really hope we can be attacking. If we sit back then you know he only wants a point.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Joelinton is the worst striker in the league as for a winger he would be pushing to win the worst winger in the championship award. Bruce is deluded.
Give murphy a chance",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
A draw is the minimum tonight! Absolutely cannot let Brighton pull away,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Murphy over joelinton and we have to give one of the strikers at least 20 mins tonight,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"If you must play Joelinton (and I've no idea why you must), then put him out wide to feed strikers with some confidence. We need someone to shoot when they're in front of goal!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Why joelinton yet again?,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Murphy was our best player after he came on the last game yet he still doesn't start our most important game of the season !,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Absolutely dreadful first half display,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Get a tenner on a Joelinton hatrick at 125/1 tonight‚Äôs the night boys!!!!! Love his hair, 40 mil well spent.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Murphy should be playing instead of Joelinton,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Dunk will Eat Joe from Linton. Carol better choice against him.,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"I must be the only one of our fans that feels bad for joe, his work rate and ability isn‚Äôt even at question for me, he‚Äôs just lacking in confidence in front of goal and that‚Äôs all some of our fans see, in a team of under performers he‚Äôs been one of the better players for me, he cost 40m, was given the number 9 shirt and we expected wonders but as i‚Äôve said many times he‚Äôs never been an out and out goal scorer, he played on the wing for hoffenheim, i want him to do well and shut some of our fans up, i personally think he has more to offer than carroll other than height and physicality, the best thing about this line up apart from obviously almiron is no krafth, really want us to win this one, we need to ‚óæÔ∏è‚óΩÔ∏è‚óæÔ∏è‚óΩÔ∏è‚óæÔ∏è",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
setting us up to hit them on the counter and defend the whole game when we should be going for this hope walks after tonight like i had up here of his rubbish tactics like,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Why, why why is Joelinton playing again? And why risk Miggy from the start should of started Carroll, Gayle, Murphy and Richie.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Has anyone done any painting.......
...............
.I'll watch it dry for you. This is dire!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Why does he persist with Joelinton....?,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"61st minute not a single shot on target so far, well done Newcastle,""you can run but you can't score""",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Glad to see Manquillo and Almiron back in the team. Now we just need to drop Joelinton and Shelvey for Gayle and either of the Longstaff's (though preferably Matty) and we might have a shot,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Why does he persist with joelinton? For the love of God he can't play as a striker,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
10 starting ....yet again ! Why doesn't he accept Woelinton is üí©?,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Wtf, Almiron will now play down the middle and Fraser on the Left no doubt. Last game was a missed opportunity having Gayle play centrally from the start. Dunno what Murphy has to do to start! Play poorly it seems and you get picked. We know Ritchie is never getting off the bench whilst Bruce is in charge, and Jokelinton will always start no matter how bad he is.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"An absolute must win game and he picks joelinton, will this never end",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Team is picked guys let‚Äôs not debate and get behind the team this game got a Fraser goal written all over it,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Buzzing miggys back üôåüèº bruce doing a good job killing matty longstaff off aswell by the looks how the fook is hendrick getting in the squad over him,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Murphy should have started looking for the sack tonight hopefully,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Murphy deserves a start today,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Not a shot on goal from us so far, rubbish!!!!!",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
have no faith in goals with joelinton on the pitch he couldnt score in a brothel,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Would play the full bench instead of the nuggets he's starting with,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"Brucie says he hasn't been good enough so why the brazillian donkey again,must be after his p45 and pay off.",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
"What is it with playing - No Goals Joelinton
Just play Gayle,
Think if he gets a decent amount of playing time he will start banging them in
That's just my opinion tho üòÉ",281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Why oh why is joe from linton playing again and why not give a murphy a chance,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3
Brighton 3-0. Won‚Äôt even both watching either. Bruce out,281,Brighton,Newcastle,Away,3

Naming two keepers on the bench is just petty playground stuff from Dyche. Okay so he doesn‚Äôt trust another U23 to step up but that‚Äôs no excuse not to include one of them in the Match-day squad over Norris and give them a taste of it so they crack on and prove to him they are ready.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1

I just wish he would give Vidra a start.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Wood scored the winner v Palace with a one on one. He‚Äôs scored many goals for Burnley. Scores lots of headers from balls whipped in from the wide men. Unfortunately due to having to rebuild from the back after Ben Mee‚Äôs absence the quality of crosses from open play and free kicks has been lacking. Clarets are on their best run of form since last season and Dyche rarely changes the side unless an injury forces him to do so. Jay and Vydra also good players who will be chomping at the bit if they are needed later in the game. It will be a tough call tonight as Wolves generally don‚Äôt give much away at the back. Could be a 1-0 either way.,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Is this a message to the board...2 keepers?!?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Sorry but Wood should be on the bench and JRod lead the attack with Barnes or Vydra. More to the point where is Vydra?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
Why no Vydra I wonder,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1
James Denslow - why not Jay Rod. Wood is so slow. No Vydra either - is he injured?,132,Burnley,Wolves,Home,1

If this is the strongest squad of players we've got we seriously need this takeover . 2 keepers 3 defenders and 3 kids is not good enough.

very niiiiccceee,203,Chelsea,Burnley,Away,2
Woodra. Very interesting. UTC,203,Chelsea,Burnley,Away,2
I‚Äôm pretty happy with that line up. Probably have preferred to see Dummett in the starting 11. Glad to see Gayle has got a start and joelinton is on the bench. HWTL!!,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Not bad at all, would like to see fraser/
Anderson come on for shelvey at some point though, just hope lascelles has shaken himself up abit, he's got a big task tonight",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Happy he is given Gayle a shot, he will be more of a problem than Carrol. I still don‚Äôt see this being a pretty score line. HWTL",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"All things considered it's pretty good. I really miss Fernandez and Clark partnership. I dunno why I just don't think Lascelles should be the captain or starting lineup but hey ho, personal opinion only.",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Great to see Gayle given a chance but still think Dummett deserves a run out as well instead of Lewis. HWTL ‚ö´‚ö™‚ö´‚ö™,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Firstly it's great to see that Hendrik is not on the pitch, good to see Gayle starting- wondering how Shelvey, Hayden, Willock and Almiron will be played as all 3 are more central type players",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Fancy a win tonight feeling optimistic with this team selection for first time in a while! Come on the toon!,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
No jokelineton there is a god nice to see gayle start prefer dummet to lascelles also not a captain but thats my opinion,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Unfortunately missing Wilson, but on the positive side Hendrick is suspended üëç",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Good to see Gayle getting a chance. But hope Almiron not been pushed out on the right after being superb in the No10 role,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Dubravka needs to start darlow has done good but has been poor the past few weeks and he's terrible on crosses,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Howay the toon I'm glad Gayle is starting and Joe willock to toon toon black and white army,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Looks a solid line up an positive. Hope gayle has a good game.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Worry seeing Kraft / lasdcelles in the side. Will miss Wilson up top but having ASM back is great! Howay,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Do i see the hand of Jones in the fact Gayle is playing as Bruce hasn't given him a sniff so far.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"What a team starting tonight, shame about Wilson. But Gayle is still a good player !! Let‚Äôs get the win.",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Best we could put out at the moment maybe play dummet instead of kraft hopefully we will give a good show,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Pretty happy with that, would've had Ritchie for Shelvey, he would naturally drop in to cover Lewis going forward. Hope Gayle is given a run in this set up",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
This is Absolutely one Hell of a Starting 11 for our one and only Mighty Toon Army VS Chelsea Away at Stamford Bridge 8PM Tonight Wor Belta Front 4 Ganning to Lead the Line very well Allan Saint Maximin Miguel Almiron Joe Willock and Dwight Gayle also great to see Wor Skipper Jamaal Lascelles back in action alongside Ciaran Clark Ganning 3.1 to our one and only Mighty Toon Army Allan Saint Maximin Joe Willock and Miguel Almiron The Goalscorer‚Äôs HWTL Forever And Always UP The Mighty Mags For Life ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Krafth terrible Lewis a defensive liability. I would rather we took a risk on Murphy and play Dummet as simple defensive left back.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
It will be interesting to see how we play. If we have a go at Chelsea instead of sitting back we could have a real chance as Chelsea's confidence is pretty fragile,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Not bad. Hope Lacelles is not rusty, he'll have a busy game.",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
good under circumstances but will do well to get points. I think relegation will be between us and Fulham now and they are playing well at moment.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Would have played dummet instead of lascelles but not a bad line up.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Would have had dubravka in goal other than that best team he could put out..,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Can't really fault that team choice tonight defenders just keep defending Darlow at the back and lets have some goals from the rest of them ‚ö´‚ö™,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
we are chasing shadows again kraft is playing next to cb instead of rb giving them so much space. Still can't defend corners you would think with SB being a cb he could train them to defend in the air,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Probably he best team he could have picked to be fair. Would probably have had a more defensive capable Dummett than Lewis, but hey we keep shouting of him to play on the front foot.",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Probably our best line up considering, at least we have 11 players (with Joelinton on the bench), hope we get at a point üëä‚öΩÔ∏èüôè",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Hopefully our front three can cause Chelsea some issues because suddenly we find ourselves really needing to pick up some points tonight and at Man U this week. Fulham have momentum and with games against Burnley and Sheffield United this week they could easily be within one point of us come next weekend! I don‚Äôt care how we play at the moment we just need to grind out positive results. If we don‚Äôt then the pressure is really on, especially when Wilson will be missing for the next 8 games or so.",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Dubravka should be back in the team, Darlow hasn't been great in recent weeks...otherwi
se a decent team",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Probably as good as it could be given injuries. Just don't like Krafth and would wven play Dummett instead.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Pretty happy with that but would have been good to get Fraser in somehow too,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Think it's time to give Darlow a rest. Has been performing acrobats over the last few weeks Its time to get Dubravka between the posts.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Great team apart from lascelles being our worst defender but HWTL,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
That would be the team I would have picked with players we have available. Playing players in their best positions now are you Brucey!,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Hopefully Mr Graeme Jones is the one who has been organising the team and running training leading up to this game, whilst Stephen Roger Bruce has been going through all of his Valentines letters from the fans (or death threats on Twitter depending on what agenda he has this week).",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"I know we have a lot of injuries so it makes sense to have Lascelles back in, however I still don‚Äôt see how he deserves the captaincy. Give it to the real leader in the middle....Isaac
Hayden.
Pretty strong lineup considering. Bit of a shame for Fraser but its nice to have that sort of attacking headache.
Dummett probably deserves the nod ahead of Lewis but hopefully tonight is the night that he finally has a great game in the Toon shirt.",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Why darlow? I get he's been good but recently he's dipping inform hopefully dubravka gets a game and doesn't think about leaving,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Best team we could of put out HWTL! need to start picking up points could be in the bottom 3 after the next 3 games,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Would prefer Ritchie on the right so Almiron can stay in number 10 role but at least Joelinton isn't starting.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Lascelles playing ü•¥. Werner will break his duck tonight with him at the back,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
How nice is it not to see Hendrick üëåüëåüëå,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Listening to tuchel he knows more about newcastle than Bruce does!,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Midfield gonna have to be on their game tonight. Plenty of pace and skill up front for them to choose from so go for it and stop the negativity of the passing backwards.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Has BRUCE had a bang on the head üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÄ,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Apart from shelvy looks quite decent HWTL,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Remember when Bruce moaned about not being able to play Frazer and Saint maximan in the same team? What's stopping him now?,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
At last Bruce has done something right..Gayle to start,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Still don't no how durabvka isn't starting ahead of darlow,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
I‚Äôd have gone with Carroll & Dummett in personally. Lascelles will have to be subbed off at half time anyhow,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Surprised Dummett didn‚Äôt get into the first 11 tonight. Good team given the circumstances. Hope we go for it from the first whistle! ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Probably the only team he could put out,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Disappointed that Lascelles is back but Fernandez and Schar are out,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Wow, actually very happy with that! Come on lads ‚ö´‚ö™",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
To much pace in Chelsea midfield shelvy will be carded in no time,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Hayden n shelvey are gonna be chasing shadows in the middle of the park, 3-0 Chelsea",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
3 massive lads at the back for Chelsea and start Gayle. Makes sense,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Well we managed half an hour before we conceded a goal,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Need a win, Chelsea not scoring to many lately, glad gayle has been given a chance tonight, not a bad line up to be honest, 1v1 I think",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Just seeing no Hendrick or Joelinton gives me hope. we start agame with 11 on the pitch, which cant be bad.",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Lewis shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to leave the training ground. The blokes useless.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
No place on the bench for the young foward ????,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Wonder what the odds are of lascelles to be booked in the first 15mins for a late tackle?,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Maybe Ritchie instead of Lewis but otherwise not to bad,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Not bad considering what we hav, the best news is joelinton not starting and there's no point bringing him on as he wont make us better",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Happy with the line up So far, anyone got any streams? At work ffs üò©",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
I think shelvey as to put more effort into the game or take him off,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"So, is it a 4-3-3 formation tonight? Glad Gayle is starting and not Mr Useless Joelinton. Willock starting again is a plus too.",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"If Hayden is playing in midfield then I rate that formation, it's got a decent balance",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Got my DAZN fired up in Calgary, Canada. HTL.",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Why are we giving their wing backs so much space?,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Their tactics aren't a give away then,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
About time Gayle plays Bruce says he tried to get him at all the clubs he has managed so why doesn't he play him more,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
About time gayle getting a start I think we'll do well the night. Toon toon army üñ§ü§çüñ§ü§çcome on the toon happy days,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"If only I could go back in time and tell everyone not to watch this drivel..week in, week out..",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
For a second I thought I saw joelinton starting. Nearly offered to tidy the kitchen instead of watching game,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Team picks itself lately.carroll frazer and murphy on late if no injuries,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
4 speedster at attacking. Lets see,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad team in all honesty...with the exception of Krafth üßÄ & how the hell does Lascelles get the captains armband? No leadership skills whatsoever & don‚Äôt even rate him as a defender! Would have like to have seen Clark or Shelvey given a chance to captain the team. Having said all that, I‚Äôm not expecting anything out of this game, but I just hope the lads at least have a go rather than roll over & die in another embarrassing circus like performance.",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
It take this long for godsake this long why its what weve all wanted,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Still putting Darlow instead of Dubravka ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Think you'll need a brick layer to brick our goal up, Newcastle had never had a defence",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Kepa ahaa wowo it's wonderful why mendy on the bench Abdurrahmaan Mohammed Adam is the best fun in newcatle üí™üí™‚ù§,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"not be long before our top forward comes on jolinton ,guaranteed",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
36 minutes and already two goals down. Complete rubbish.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Last day is 3weeks late,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Best team he could of picked happy with that,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Win or lose will take the result with this kind of lineup. Shows seriousness unlike lining up Joelinton.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Thank god Joelinton isn‚Äôt upfront all I could if asked for tonight!,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
How on earth do the longstaffs get on the bench I do not know are they still bringing pasties in for big Steve Bruce,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Nice to see Jones getting a shot at picking the starting line up,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Kepa in goal

Shelvey should just shoot anywhereüòÇ",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Best he could of picked today like cabbage heed,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Either 4-3-3 or 4-1-4-1 ü§î,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Beat these tonight then Man U on Sunday,show some fight and pride in the shirt...Toon Toon ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Decent line up. Glad he went with Gayle rather than Joelinton,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Probably as good as we could of picked cmon the toon looks set up to go at them ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Happy with that team apart from Shelvey ,he needs moved on .",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Best side he could put out at the moment , hopefully steal a draw",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Great to see gayle instead of jokelinton,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Would have given us half a chance tonight without the three injuries v Soton. We still might,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Great to see Joelinton on the bench.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Famous last words... this starting eleven is probably our best available without Wilson. Feeling like we will get a win tonight. HWTL!,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
I really hope Gayle takes his chance to shine,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Can't see anything but a loss üòû but good luck lads üôè,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Good luck to the lads tonight think there going to need it x,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
As good as we can expect. Some hope storing.,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
am happy with that like could of been a lot worse,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"About the best he could of picked, I thought dubravka may have started",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Big performance needed against an in form Chelsea. Howay the Toon!!!,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
"Very interesting to see Gayle start, everytime he‚Äôs come on he looked decent",233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
433 go on Bruce that's the one. HOWAY THE LADS !!!!,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
As good as it could be.. like the front 4 !!!,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Well done assistant manager for picking that team üëè,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Graeme Jones has picked a canny team there üëçüèª,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
We are winning by a goal today .,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Am liking the look of that team. üëç hope we can get a result tonight. Come on the toon!!!!,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Looks like we have a team go and get them keep the faith FAN's HWTL's,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Gayle the right man up top for me. Good Luck lad,233,Chelsea,Newcastle,Away,2
Lindelof again????!!!! Why is Ole so stuck on him? Hes not as good as Bailly. And Henderson deserves to be starting too. By far the best keeper at the club.,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"How ole trusts lindelof over Bailey suprises me
Anyways good luck to the team
Nothing less than a win
GGMU",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"A good line up though I would have preferred the pairing of Bailly at the back, we need a player who is faster and more calculative at the back. The CB is my only fear. Let's just hope for the best this evening and I see us winning for the 4th at Stanford bridge.",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Nice to see Martial on the bench üòä,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"Buzzing ryt now, Martial is on the bench where he belongs & guess what!!!! McTominay is back. I was really hoping for Bailly to start this game , he had a good game against real sociedad

Come On United üî¥‚ö´Ô∏è let‚Äôs collect all 3 Points",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"Lindelof again?! We‚Äôll lose baily and henderson in the summer at this rate ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Hoping the forwards can get going, nice to see Greenwood starting again üëå",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"Ole prefers Lindelof over Bailley which means we have to score at least three so we don't draw...
It is well with Manchester United...",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Can't understand why Bailly doesn't start even after Lindel√∂f's shaky performances. Otherwise this is perhaps the best XI to start with.,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Martial on the bench. Hope to see Marcus and Mason rotating as no 9 during the match. Sad that Bailly is relegated back to bench,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"Good lineup except Lindelof, I don't trust this guy at the back. We need three points üëâüëà, common red Devils!",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"I won't accept anything Less than 3 points
Let's go out there and take our chances.
Time to be ruthless in front of goal

"We not gonna lose bailly over Chelsea. We have so many games to play, the CBs have kept clean sheets against top 6 this season. Worry about our attack, not defence. Come on United üî¥‚ù§",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Thank god no Martial. Playing a slightly injured James is the better option.,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"Our CBs partnership of Maguire and Lindelof is always so shaky, will cause our team to struggle as usual. Bailly is obviously the stronger and meaner CB. Ole never sees this. All the same good luck to us as we will need it. Don‚Äôt screw it up as Leicester dropped points today",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"What is it with this manager with Lindelof and Maguireüò°
Always setting us up to fail",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
That small happiness Tuchel brought to Chelsea fans faces is ending today because Manchester united players would shock them by God gress! .... üòéüòé,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"Winning TEAMüôèüí™. I now a days do not care whoever is fielded in, I have come to learn to trust the decision of the manager and the coaching team. They know better.
We are behind you lads, let's win this together üôè",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Lindelof and maguire at CB ok then I won‚Äôt be watching this game because I refuse to let the chuckle brothers steal my happiness.#GMU,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"James and lindelof playing, an away loss today then. We will never compete again with city for the league. Look at their team yesterday was so good and the bench cost over ¬£200m, they will dominate for years now",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"I am only concerned with the CBs and their sloppy mistakes, they should help the goalkeeper to do his best too.",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"This much your must win because
This boy is one of manchester united fans in myanmar and he is shot by polices and soldiers today. He gave his life for our country democary.Today,

Once again the coach's stupid decisions will probably cost us the game. Anyone can see Bailly is a better CB than both the starting guys and even worse he makes them look good when playing with either of them ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0

Military coup in Myanmar is killing innocent protests by using real guns, real bullets including snipers. They even shot medical stuffs, embulances, teachers, hospitals, and so on.

Today, one young Manchester United fan in Yangon, Myanmar was killed by disgusting military coup. His friend posted about the sad news and mentioned that they two can't watch the football matches and can't argue anymore.

Military coup in Myanmar is cutting off the internet from 1am to 9am everyday. Since this match starts from 11pm here, I hope his soul may watch the match from heaven peacefully and I wish he can see his favourite team's victory.

Dear international Manchester United fans, thank you a lot whoever reading this message till the end. As you all know, we football fans in Myanmar are also fighting for democracy and trying to get justice back. I hope we can watch football matches together, fighting and connecting with you guys again.

"Great choice!
Put Rashford as a striker and Fred-Scot in the midfield. Come on Manchester United...",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Everyone complaining about Lindelof ahead of Bailly should be saying Bailly instead of Maguire. Lindelof and Bailly would be much better. But because Maguire the captain and English he won‚Äôt ever be dropped.,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
After Bruno Fernandez we've got a good stability in our team but we still need a world-class finisher to score goals and one centerback who can hold. That's how Ferguson did by getting Van Persie. I think it's time to get Erling Haaland,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
I don‚Äôt really know what they see on Mctominay.. honestly we Matic should be on. We need a leader and someone who can hold the midfield and distribute passes. Mctominay is just going to run around and Fred will do the dirty work.,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0

"I do not know what Ole sees in the Maguire and Lindelof duality and the others do not see him..He is determined to associate them with each other, and we all know that we have lost many points because of this duality..I think that he does not want to win or he wants to annoy us and implement one of his stupid ideas.",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0

This Manchester United are not fit to win thy League cuz they don't play good game look thy way they play oh they make me painful always.,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"Why don't you give this guy a breathing space,
It is clear that he knows what he is doing, in most of our previous matches it doesn't bench Martial but now he has realised that Martial is unreliable and he has started benching him so for now if he feels that lindelof should start ahead of bailly, we can only let him do his job we can keep supporting and keep trusting him",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Put bailly in the starting 11 what does he have to do to get a start a head of the fridge!,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"Ole picking his boyfriend lindelof over Bailly, looks like 3 goals are needed to win then",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Why lindelof? We know that Maguire no go area for Ole but benching Bailly aint a gud move,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Will miss Martial in starting eleven. Cavani Pogba big miss. I would have played Matic instead of James coz we can't lose this game for top 4,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
I don't know why Ole doesn't trust Bailly in big matches but prefers Lindelof who is a very shaky partner with Maguire,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
We play bailly we keep a clean sheet maguire plays we concede cheap goals and when your manager is stubborn enough to overlook it then you know the club has a problem!!!,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Eric Bailey is a far better CB than The weak Lindelof. Only Ole sees otherwise hmm. Anyways nice to see Martial on the bench.,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Need our scoring boots on because the clean sheet is West i‚Äôd guess,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Let's win this match!!! I think Ole had a big trust for Lindelof so he will play well on this match. Good luck to this team!,251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
"Here we go again
The magalof partnership of doom continues
Please for God's sake let de Gea keep a cleans sheet because if Bailly was here obviously a clean sheet
But o well let's hope and see
But ole is stubborn all the same",251,Chelsea,Man Utd,Away,0
Once again no comment about the line up I just wish them the very best how I wish ole can explain to use on what earth he can leave our Eric out in such a game n bring in linderfol.

Give Cedric a four year deal to then play someone out of position at right back. Trust the process! üôà,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Good line-up. But we will miss xhaka at the middle of the park.,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Clueless coach, Arteta. He plays players out of their right positions and demands good results. 3 right backs yet Holding is ahead of them. We have Gabi and Pepe who are wingers yet forces ESR to play there",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Dear Arsenal, we‚Äôve lost everything this season, but please tonight make sure you play for the badge.. Our dignity is at stake.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Glad to see Saka at RW but who is right back. Mari? Also feel more confident when KT is in the team! Definitely a more defensive line up. So Hope Auba will not be a ghost. Disappointed to see Pepe benched again! How is he meant to gain an consistent form? Have a feeling we could get hammered. But we must not forget this is a derby and pride is on the line! Good luck Gunners!,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
So Cedric is in the team but holding is played in that position and then we're told to trust the process. Even an amateurish coach will know this ain't right. This Arteta guy should have gone long time ago!,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
It's so hard to understand this process ayi! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...what have we done as Arsenal fans üòî. Imagine if you're Bellerin or Cedric and the Coach prefers someone else in your position üòêüòê I'm out of words,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
I can't quite place Arteta! What is he playing? I thought this is a must win game if we're to qualify for the Conference League. So what is this? Not playing your best players. Playing players out of position,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
We should continue loosing games if that's what will make Kroenke and Arteta to leave us alone.,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Let's hope this list of all known names play like a united team. They have belief in themselves and each other? ü§î,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Interesting line up! Maybe we should have trusted Chambers. Hopefully, Partey won't make costly mistakes in the game. Good luck boys!",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"I will highlight why Arteta will never be good for Arsenal one the whole season he has never known his best 11,two the decisions he made like loaning Guendozi,kolasn
ac ,torreira when we needed those reinforcement is a proof of inexperienced coach,three he has lost respect from the players ,four kroenkes will always control him like a little boy and he will never rule in his own will,i can keep on going on till the end",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"With Partey in this line up, nothing will come out, cos he's end up passing the ball backwards all the time, and losing passion easily.. Arteta always rotate the players, thereby making them not to have understanding amongst themselves.. He should resign and leave our team for good..",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Just a reminder that it's likely we won't be boarding a plane for next season's midweek big dogs gae we'll be using buses
BT it's time to atleast defend our only pride
That's the London pride let's make it red as usual
NB am posting this in unconscious mind and body so help us God",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
We prettey much have an average squad but we should be in a better position at this stage. Arteta has been making poor decisions when it comes to his starting XI.,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Arteta is just an apprentice in this job always rotate players nd this could a rough understand of themselves on the pitch,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"#COYG. Fixing the impossibilities
. Arteta is in the lab doing experiment. Playing mari and Gabi at the same time. We shall win the game",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
The most inconsistent line up in the EPL this season. All the best!,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
For the sake of pride we have to win this and shows the others that we are still competitive enough to challenge at the highest level.,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Get Eddie Howe as the manager and we will go places this areteta favours players odegaard is Goin bk to Madrid what is he playing him for give the youngsters a chance we playin for pride there's 2 under 21 players would walk into this team any day and show some spark Azeez and Balogun,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"We have Bellerin, Cedric and Chambers but Arteta decided to play Holding at right back. Incredible!",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Holding @ right backüòïüòï, poor team selection. Arteta is one useless and clueless gambler, not the results we wanted",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Let's trust the process. Throughout the season arteta don't know his first eleven. And the board still believe in him. Anyway thank goodness that nothing can give me heartbreak cos Arsenal alone has make me stronger.,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Plus of course Every successful side has a quality keeper at it‚Äôs base....that‚Äôs why City and Liverpool bought quality keepers and went up.... Martinez gave us this and we won the FA cup, community shield, but what did Arteta do?? He sold him and bought back the weak Leno (good shot stopper but error prone and poor up close).",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"When you realise Arsenal have escaped the likes of Juventus..Liver
pool...Lyon. and borrusia dortmund in Europa league you can marginally understand arteta and arsenal shambolic season ha ha ha",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Arteta is the fool of the year, why waste a full position by playing both Smith Rowe and odegard I can't wait to see odegard out of arsenal back to Madrid because he's another ozil as far as laziness is concerned",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Cedric and bellerin on the bench with holding at right back . Pretty much sums up arteta .clueless . No best starting 11,no best formation,every
week,different set up .",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Have you seen pepe stats?.
If you have then we all know he needs to be on the line up ..but I respects the managers choice.
Let's win this.
CoYG.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Arteta will kill me with stress one day, Arteta want to destroy Arsenal beyond repair. Your facing the mighty Chelsea under the mighty management of Thomas Tuchel, you don't even know what kind of players to select to face that good team, playing Odegard and Smith Row at the same time against a well built club like Cheese.
That's a clear signal that Arsenal is facing a lost direction.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Lower your expectations guys, I care about your feelings. Watch while sober cz anything can happen. I don't want you to come here after the game crying. Just lower your expectations, thanks",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
3-4-2-1 formation... Hope it pays off. That's one of the formations that can hurt Chelsea and give them a hard time üí™,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ wait until the end of the match, the pain will be successfully landed to the rented bridge boys",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Arteta you have been a player before...How would you feel on your position to play a defender?Your playing with players mind.2 right back on the bench yet ur playing a centre back on the rightüò†,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Why bench Pepe? He is trying to get his confidence back but Arteta seems not to want him to deliver. Poor team selection. Holding at RBüòî,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Holding at Right back when we Have Chambers and Soares.... Without even considering Bellerin...Arte
ta knows nothing about football he is just a gambler",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"3 right backs on the bench yet I
Can‚Äôt see one on the pitch. I don‚Äôt know what this man thinks of himself. This is more confusing than the false 9 one. I hope it pays off",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
This line up can't win Chelsea a will just watch the game due to I love arsenal,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"To be sincere Arteta is not a good manager, can't play against Chelsea without a natural right back then Arteta need to understand Smith Rowe plays better when he is number 10 without Martin,you can't experiment the whole season he is clueless because with that you only win when you're lucky but no consistency, the whole right wing is dead with Pulisic attacking.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
We really don't care all we want is KROENKE OUT,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Wtf three center back holding,Mari gabriel no right back, still insisting in playing odegard and Smith Rowe in the same team .
we're getting slayed today but I pray not any way
#COYG
#ARTETAOUT
#KROENKEOUT",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Peer pressure from Arteta is the reason why arsenal has been languishing between 10th & 9th for 10months ...he tends to copy pep guardiola's tactics forgetting he has jokers in the squad,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
But why doesn't Arteta leave Arsenal and go?...So which kind of line up is this?? Bringing Smith Rowe and Odeegard in the same match and leave pepe or Martinelli on bench,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Arteta is a serious joker why playing 3 at the back when all the players are fit,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Chopping and changing formation is what Arteta is good at.
Almost two years at Arsenal no identity, the board is a joke.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"how can we play such a defensive game thrs why we love we play a defensive game and it shows our fear..
fuk this arteta is clueless...a team like leads fears no team its winning games because they play no defensive game they play hard and pushes ...we play slow ball and defensive game we lose...arteta copies gurdiola in everything now he is playing pep format and defending ...fuk this style of coping pep.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
I‚Äôll never understand Arteta‚Äôs team selection. This is definitely something he needs to get right next season. Why isn‚Äôt Cedric playing?,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Game 36 and we don't have identity till now. We don't have a starting up 11.,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
We lost everything let's try to secure our 9th place,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
My problem is why laca isn't in the frontline,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Has martinelli been banging arteta‚Äôs wife or something? Why doesn‚Äôt he get much game time???,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Some of these comments would have been so different if we were in the Europa League Final..but we are NOT some ""Fans"" need to get over that..one season does not define a team",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"The team selection and changes were fantastic.
Always happy to watch players who are ready to sacrifice everything for the team.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
why do we have to play this game when we already know the outcome? The best teamüî¥‚ö™ will win tonightüëç,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Where are the likes of Azeez and Balogun????? Surely now is the time to get them in? Ready for next season?,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
I think arsenal will get a surprise win today but that doesn't justify artetas shambles. He is a good for nothing kind of a couch,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Am waiting the final whistle for you to update us ""a loss in north london"" but...all the best Gunners ‚ù§Ô∏è",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"No need of all these fuss,we all know Arteta has no starting 11.
Let's hope this squad will protect our pride n badge",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Meaning we are in to defend against Chelsea? Why Chambers benched and Cedric not even on the bench? As for Bellerin, that one has expired...
Anything short of 3 points against Chelsea is unacceptable from we Fans.....",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Always rotating players , anyway let's just pray hard because Arsenal doesn't have a Manager at all. im sure if Ljunberg was still our acting Manager we would be in UCL positions 3 or 4th place this week but too bad we made a big mistake and now regretting after appointing a pretender who is a CLOWNüë∫üë∫ who have no idea in selection at all",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"I fear Gabriel,he might cost us today as usual,still don't want to criticize him but we never win when he starts,not careful poor marking,good stability,poor decisions,just in uniform not a jersey, hope he will play in his jersey today.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"This team will probably play like they want Arteta sacked as well......its like they've been trying all season with the below par performances...
.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
So Martinelli will never get enough game time to prove himself bt Arteta believes the Real bench warmer is better? Clueless coach giving loanees gametime at the expense of our players,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"In typical Arsenal style now there is NOTHING to play for, they will more than likely deliver a win and a good performance tonight #bottlemerchants",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Arteta never learns. Smith and Odegaard can't be in the same line up üò°,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Arteta is a joker in team selection , benching the best and playing players out of position ,# Auba , Holding , Smith",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"I hope it's a back three,, you cannot and should not and should never attempt dream about think about or even try to play holding as a right back",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Very confused coach, how will the team prevail with inconsistent team selection",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Not sure why he didn't go with more youngsters give them a chance to see if they up for premier league football Azeez Balogun still can't make March day squad Balogun from time signed new contract not even on the bench not sure wat system he playing holding looks like he will play right back and he has no pace we fans can see the problems sitting at home yet this areteta can't see nothing,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"With this rotation we are doomed, No number 2, leaving wingers on the bench Pepe and martineli is a disgrace to us and playing Smith Rowe on their positions is a mess, arteta is a comedian not a coach.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"""What is the best way not to be criticized on the starting 11 at the start of the game?""

Arteta: Confuse everyone with line up so no body understand anything.

Let's see what new trick this is.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Interesting, maybe we are going 3 at the back. Tierney LWB and Saka RWB",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"A good win today, but we need to learn how to press as it has a way of destabilizing the opponent's play.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Are we really trying to cash up with Tottenham in the 7th place? With this selection 3 right back on the bench, I thought he said he doesn't have a good pre season, why not start now",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Having this feeling we gonna be well beaten

4:1 won't be bad for an awful team.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
If winning this match will make Kroenke and Arteta remain I think we better loss,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Arteta is a learner.....He hasn't finished his apprenticeship before Arsenal hired him,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Arsenal will never make head way with Arteta in charge. How can you play Holding at right back while Cedric is fit. Keeps alternating the players in different position,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
We are in the last three matches yet Arteta has not settled on his 1st eleven leave alone his philosophyüòå. This Everton legend should just pack and leave. He is a murderer walking with blood in his hands,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"The arsenal coach is a failure ...its time to look at the juniors ...nelson ,azeez etc ...the loaned players failed to improve us why play them ???",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"This is good..strong bench..I hope it goes well..I have always wanted to see partey+el neny then saka,rowe and √òdegaard play together..",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
So PEPE is being rested for the big game on the weekend against Crystal Palace..!!?? Wow.Arteta will show us things. Relegation mentality..,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
I don't like it when √òdegaard plays as a 10 at the expense of ESR. üëéüëé,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Why changes every game that's why we are losing terribly,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Why are we playing odegaard? Our season is over and we aren‚Äôt keeping him because Real Madrid won‚Äôt let us. Another opportunity for martinelli to get some playing time and instead Arteta gives it to another teams player. So much for a process.,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
You got 3 RB in the bench but use CB to be RB.. What the terrible coach that we have. Huh!,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"I prefered Pepe to start to pressurize their defence but the formation isn't really bad coz ESR and √òdegaard will both create chances and compromise their defence with passes from no where, it's gonna cause confusion for them on whom to tackle between them... And boom they can pass to either of Saka or Tierney easily as well.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Is it only me dat does not understand this line up?, is holding playing right back or its 3 center back, we have cedric on the bench with his energy",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"With this line up, let's manage expectations.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"This is a good lineup,arsenal should have been consistent with it from the start of the season,
That defensive partnership is so optimisticüòç",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Using a make shift right back yet you have three natural fully fit right backsü§îü§îü§î Which mediocre tactics are these??,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"The problem with arteta is the fact that he can‚Äôt keep same team sheet for three straight matches , he keeps switching players and disorganizing the team",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Fact is that this guy needs like 4-6 years of INTENSE coaching drill before he is good enough for ANY club. His display of confusion depicts incapacity to handle this team. Not good enough,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Why put rowe and odegaard in squad while they play in the same position took one in then martnell with abu in,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"It doesn't matter who starts. We are about to witness another soulless and thoughtless performance by Arsenal. Well unless of course, Arteta is sacked",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"All the best Gunners
Can't doubt this lineup for me i guess it is the best lineup lets go gunners",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Holding at right backüòÑ, easy game for Chelsea. Arteta is clueless.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Cmon... We played already fist part of the season with 3 center backs and we saw it is not working. Infact we changed into two center back formation in Chelsea game and won it when nobody believed that they can be won after the slump.,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"No win, because there is no attack, Auba is one man down. I hate him for not being serious.
Why not play:
Laca, even though he loves missing but he will pressure the attack. And Pepe he is getting back in form.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"I am yet to appreciate Odegard in the attacking midfield position over ESR.
I would probably have him come off the bench for him.
Then have Pepe on the left wing.
3-5-2 formation, never been my desired one",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"So there are 3 right back in bench none in the field
This man call Mikel Arteta is not a coach pls
What is wrong with this man
What kind of formation is this
This is bullahit",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Why aren't you playing a proper right back.. so bizarre.. he's basically saying I don't trust Cedric bellerin or chambers,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Over 1 year in the job and we still don't know our or have a stable starting 11. Chopping and changing every week...,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1

"Arteta your plan to stress me will not work...

So your plan is to play defensive game.. can someone please ask him that what else are we trying to protect this season.ü§∑ü§∑",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"I think this season saka(19 years old) as much play time(consistent

When you keep rotating the lineup like a pendulum..what do yu expect my coach? Why not have a formidable and consistent lineup where the players get to understand each other every playtime?,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"So we are going in this game with respect to Chelsea right? I see a fluid formation that is a 5 at the back and 4 2 3 1 when attacking. Why do we do this, give too much respect to big teams in the first half, we always end up losing. Just play football, atleast give Mendy a run for his money. Test that defence from kick off. Not telling the players that we are going to have to defend alot.",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
arteta is still doing his squad trial i dnt like it two number tens in the line up smith and martin thts how we failed in villareal its about to repeat ...,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
"Very useless Coach how on Earth can he play 2 no:10s at the same time against a strong opponent.
What will bring the balance in midfield defensively?",356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1
Arteta is not a Coach. He should go coach 3rd tier division team. How can you play (Holding as RB) and also playing both Smith Rowe and Ordeegard knowing well their all Playmakers while Martinelli is there. Clueless doesn't know anything about Coaching,356,Chelsea,Arsenal,Away,-1

If it was my own money, that would be a different story...",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
We know we‚Äôre average but have you seen their team. No great shakes. Be positive although i know it‚Äôs hard. Toon win or draw!ü§ûüèº,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Hendricks n Snailvey off and Fraser and Murphy and its strong, bit to many defensive players on just in different positions against a average prem team, we need to take the game to them",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Hold on...we‚Äôre almost getting to the point where you could make a better starting XI with players who aren‚Äôt playing than those that are:
Dubravka, Yedlin, Lascelles, Schar, Hayden, Ritchie, St Maximin all not playing. Geez. Had Shelvey and Almiron not been starting that pretty much would fill out the side!",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Jeff ""Pass it back"" Hendrick. Solid",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Why is Joe Linton playing there must be someone else who can play instead unless he's been told to defend with the rest lol,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Is that Andreas Anderson on the bench? Got to be better than Joelinton,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Feel a bit sorry for Murphy who I think has played ok considering it‚Äôs as a wing back. This formation would have suited him better. Glad to see Shelvey back. Long staff had no great creativity or passing. Wilson back is a big plus.,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Need an early night so this will do the job just perfect. Should be asleep by half time,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Tried and tested 43111. Who says Bruce doesn't know what he's doing? Genius,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
1-0 Palace almost a guarantee,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Ginola, Robert, Gillespie, Lee, Speed, Butt, Nolan, Solano just to name a few - were miles off this with the likes of Hendrick & Hayden ect üôÑ Get some quality in!!",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Longstaff and Hendrick that is 11 vs 9...,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
I hope CP will share the ball with us unlike those horrible Chelsea lot who wouldn‚Äôt give us a kick?,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Not much hope !would be happy with a draw !!!,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Loving Anderson on the bench! 4-4-2 from the Brucemeister,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Back 4 with shelvey and Hendricks sitting with miggy on the right joelintion on the left and longstaff as a number 10 behind Wilson longstaff and Wilson and Fernandez to score and the toon win 3-1,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Guess it‚Äôs the strongest we can pick out of the players available,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Someone explain to me how Hendrick walks into the first team every week. Please.,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Cannot believe that Hendrick is anyhwere near this starting line up let alone starting a game again!!! He's been utterly useless!!,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Hayden, Lascelles and Maxi nowhere to be seen, the same 3 who apparently are unhappy with Mrs Doubtfires methods, player revolt is starting, P45 for the cabbage ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2

"Hoping, with 4 at the back, instead of keeping up Murphy on the bench, will have a better result. Hwtl",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Looks a far better team. Hopefully the tactics are to actually cross the halfway line.üò≥,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Hendrick and Joelinton just says it all clueless both championship players if that,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
We shall still get beat by the better side no imagination Bruce. Hendrick says it all.,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"That lineup wouldn't frighten me granny.........
..Not anticipating much from this. Hope I'm wrong.",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
so stoked to see our star No. 9 starting! Goals coming from him tonight definitely!,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Were gonna lose i know that. And we are gonna do the same thing as usual sit back and defend,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"On paper that looks like 4 at the back...... but we all know one of them lucky boys will be 5th defender......w
hy matty longstaff isnt in instead of hendrick is anyones guess",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Think Bruce might be off the drugs tonight only 4 at the back and a decent line up we need 3 points tonight,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Id of put ritchie and murphy in for hendrick and longstaff,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Maradona‚Äôs nose runs faster than that central midfield.,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Come on Shelvey run the show , Howay the lads",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"So, it looks like Maxi is one of the isolating players.",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Joelintons there. Im brimming with confidence!,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Not a bad line up !! And good to see Ritchie back on the bench !!,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Buzzing with 4 at the back, but I swear to God, if that's Jeff Hendrick on the right when we have both Ritchie and Murphy on the bench then I may go and top myself ü§£",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
3 players self isolating now we know who they are.,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Fingers crossed, just 1 request from your fan base. Get up among them & have a go. Please.",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Looking at that I can see the formation 8-1-1,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
What's up with yedlin? it has been long i have seen him play. Anyone with a clue?,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
433 surely. Miggy - right and Joe - left?,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Pleased to see Miggy starting,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2

Hayden got covid then? By process of elimination,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Is this match on TV? - I cant find it,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Hayden? Injured?,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
No Hayden? Covid or injury?,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Hope we actually bloody try winning tonight...!,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Where's St Maxi?,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Is that a 4-2-3-1? Or even a 4-3-3?,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Glad shelvey is back in,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Unbelievable that Bruce can select joelinton. Must be great for team morale.,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Few beers ,away win .Happy night ü§û",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Is match on TV?,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2

Why doesn't Allan have a line up? üòßüòßüòß,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Anderson ,would like a look at him.",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Is match on sky or anything ?,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2

What‚Äôs he playing 433?,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Let‚Äôs... give the boys all our support... but I have to say#BRUCEOUT,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Now. Enough of the boring play. Let's have some fun tonight, please! ENTERTAIN US!",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Did Shelvey shave off his eyebrow? üòÇ,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Surely Murphy has to be ahead of Hendrick?? He‚Äôs absolute dogshite!!,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Welcome back Matt Ritchie,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Glad to see the back of the wing back systemü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è its horrendous. Still not confident the way we're playing atmüôÑ,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Young Anderson on the bench I see, hope we get to see him at some point",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
They don't have Zaha so I am optimistic here.,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Just want to see some attacking threat tonight,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Is that team even a top 4 championship team ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
The bench is stronger than the starters üòÇüòÇüòÇ,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
This boys need to play harder men. Two loss in a row !,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Let's hope we get a decent performance of the Lads up the toon army üëç,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
442 that I think and a strongee bench this week,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Nice try...now go back and have another go!!,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Drop Hendrick and Joelinton play with nine men .,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
We might get the ball past halfway for once,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Hope we go out to play tonight, no rolling over for 90 min defending",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
We are going to get battered,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Oh good! Shelvey‚Äôs back. More sideways and backwards passing to look forward to üôÑ,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Bruce has got to go man maquilo and Hendrick fml,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Why hendrik ffs id rather bruce play himself, would be more mobile",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Hopefully brings on Anderson in the second half to give him some game time. Just hope don't park The bus,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Nice to see clarky back in the team,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
What does Hendrick have to do to get dropped.,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Glad Jonjo was captain,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
See hendricks back starting üôÑgood Lord,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Nice to see Anderson on the bench,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Jesus 4 at the back is Brucey ok,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Almid√≥n change by "" Nobby Jr"" Vilca Antonio Svq",94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Where‚Äôs the other 7 defenders,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Not a winger in sight,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Hendrick must be Bruces drinking partner there both clueless,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
That's either 4-5-1 or he's playing Hendrick as a bloody winger againü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Hope we get to see Anderson....,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Anderson on the bench hope he gets on,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
how on earth has hendrick found his way back in the starting 11üòÇ,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Clearly Hayden with the virus,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
How does hendrick keep getting in the team,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Joelinton Hatrick tonight ??????odds please,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Typical toon will get beat like usual,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
Championship game on instead what a joke,94,Crystal Palace,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Personally think he‚Äôs playing 4-5-1

"What in the hell is Arteta playing Pepe on the Left and Saka on the right when it‚Äôs the exact opposite that those two best positions are at....... not to mention thy since Tierny is in, he and Saka make an awesome link up. Argh.",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Best line up! Saka and ESR partnership ‚úä Pepe should be careful while dribbling, he shouldn't kill the game; Partey should even try to score today coz he has killed many birds with his shot üòÇ
Lest I forget, nice Jersey, I hope we win with out new away kit. COYG üî¥‚ö™",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
It will end in tears tonight ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. Arteta is an amateur coach.,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Why can't you give Martinelli a chance??, why play chambers instead of cedric n he was our best player when Bellerin was injured? Why play Auba instead of Lacazette yet Auba has been poor the entire season? Poor coach, no experience, doesn't understand the strength of his squad",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Says a lot for this current squad when this is ‚Äòprobably‚Äô our strongest line-up.,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
It seems like Arteta failed to help us in the season so let's get Ancelloti . Hope he will take us to next levels,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Only two more games left until half of our squad leaves üôèüôå,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Good XI but Lacazette deserve to play in front ahead of Auba.,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"I love the fact that there is no passion from the players. We nicked it, we don‚Äôt deserve it. Lack of conviction",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Just Loved to see the loanee keeper and those youngsters given a chance,win or lose we aren't going anywhere, this truck over turned along time back!",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Really Arteta wants to serve his job tonight.
Great selection, now let's gun them down üîª. #coyg",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Nearly predicted his lineup, thought he would pick Martinelli ahead of Saka",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"I don't even care now! The season ended for me when we couldn't get to the Europa final. Hopefully, we will bounce back stronger next season. All the best lads!",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Come on you Gunners. 2 games left let‚Äôs make it two wins. A fair line up I‚Äôd say! But will someone please tell me why Cedric seem to have gone missing these last few weeks!,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Why does he like changing everytime the center back pairing. No wonder our defensive can never get better. Everytime u being paired with a different one.,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Worthless game then he goes all guns blazing but important games he goes random new formation...,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"I like it when BS7 and ESR Play this close to eachother, their chemistry is so awesome. They connect better...",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Everyone who is selected today must know how important this match is. Like Arteta always says it‚Äôs mathematically possible we can get European football next season. #COYG,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
If Willian and Ceballos are going at the end of the season. Why are they in the squad for tonight.,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Arteta is now getting his best lineup at the end of the season... But is too late to turn things around.,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Waited so long before picking his best xi..
But still not sure about pepe n saka positioning, i think Arteta should stick with one of them on the right and play martinelli from the left. Well hope we pick maximum point and expect a miracle",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
The team is almost perfect! except that Gabriel is too feverish. Mari had to start this match.,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Glad elnenys playing he's so under rated for us and a great partner for partey. Still no clue as to why martinelli can't get frequent game time though mental....,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"We are going to lose this match!
Neny, Pepe and Chambers. What a poor lineup.",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"I don't expect folks to stress themselves over this inconsequential
game. Its just a post season game, that's all.",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Is Partey going to turn up tonight? Probably not, Crystal Palace, no push over tonight, they played well at the weekend, I‚Äôd of left him out, but we‚Äôll seeüôÑ",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Give Reiss, Bologuan, Ryan(gk) Azez, Martinelli & Cedric a chance to play these remaining matches.",364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
This lineup is good and I expect a win. Let's be there to support our team ‚öΩ‚öΩ,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Why always bench lacazette and martinelli???!,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Next season Kindly send Arteta on Loan. He is clueless in team selection. Our style of play is never interesting. The number of throw ins we have given out surpasses both shots on Target and off.,364,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Away,-2
Shelvey and hendrick nightmare paring in CM? We will get over run with out doubt,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Id rather Krafth or Clark play CM than hendrick ffs, he offers absolutely nothing and certainly can't control the centre of the pitch ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Well they‚Äôve clearly took a strong hand on jokelinton breaking the rules, think making him watch us is a massive punishment üòÇüòÇ",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Not to mention the 5-4-1 and not starting ASM, he does not have much more he do quality wise. If he didnt lose the dressing room and had more passion and desire he can pass to the players however, we would be a top half team.... Bottom of the Top Half but scrape 9th 10th place",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Starting with 10 men again I see. Am I missing something? I know I should be supporting the team etc.....but what is Hendrick contributing. I know we haven‚Äôt got massive squad depth but surely he‚Äôs had enough chances and someone else worthy of a chance by now.
If St Maximam is fit enough for the bench then he‚Äôs fit enough to start, even if only for an hour....he will contribute more within that hour then any other player at the club, it‚Äôs so Frustrating supporting this club!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"I am honestly past caring... we will without doubt be fighting in the bottom 3 soon.
I cannot see a way out of this like. League 1 here we come",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Lewis and Hebdrick aren't good enough.... So please prove me wrong.

1st time we've had a relatively settled starting 11.

Still if we don't start to win. What is the chuffin point in Steve Roger Bruceü§î???

His job must be hanging by the last few threads",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Does this bloke never learn? Went 4 at the back second half against Leeds, play well. Back to a back five the next game. Nice one üëç",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
This is the day we show the premier league what we‚Äôre about. We‚Äôve had good preparation for today and we‚Äôve dusted ourselves down,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Jeff Hendricks? I hope he has the game of his life today. Come on Newcastle.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Keeping playing Negative football with this 5-4-1 that isloates Callum sometimes. I would rather take off Hendricks, bring hayden into midfield along with Shelvey and start Saint Allan Maximin on the left wing with Almion on the right and Joelinton behind Wilson. The team needs goals",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Bruce just can't help himself. Says he wants to play further forward and more attacking and then does the opposite.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"That's a unbalanced side if hes going to play with 3 up front as the Chronicle is predicting.

If we are playing 5 at the back that means hayden is a centre half? It's a losing team again.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"5-4-1. When will Bruce ever learn ffs. Darlow in goals again, and the useless Hendrick. Looks like Ritchie is on his way, hasn‚Äôt even made the bench, the lad is a grafter and leader and has given us so much. Awful signings from Bruce, playing them only shows how much worse we are under him.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Here we go again.... defend for 75 minutes, won‚Äôt come off our own box and hope we don‚Äôt concede.

Bring ASM on with 15 min to go, but too late as we‚Äôll have conceded too many by then and game will be dead!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Unbelievable. Really is. Surely he's fit enough to start??? Changed the game against Leeds. He must have 70mins in him. He only runs forward ASM,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"The man is a complete and utter ü§°. Set up for another defeat absolutely clueless St Maximum benched why am i suprised.Cabbag
e Heed taking us to loss number 12 sack him ffs.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Ah yes, the ever mobile central midfield partnership of Hendrick and Shelvey once more. I give up, he‚Äôs never going to get it is he ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Thats a Losing Side. we need Hayden in Central Midfiled with Shelvey. Clark at the Back in Defence With Lascelles . Well done Steve Keeping the loosing Form Going .. Mike Ashley Book Him a Taxi For Gods Sake...,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
We have got to start Playing Matty Longstaff in the Centre of Midfield with Isaac Hayden instead of Jeff Hendrick and Jonjo Shelvey because they have not been good at all for our one and only Mighty Toon this Season so Far and they need to Learn from the Mistakes that have cost us Matches but it‚Äôs Belta that Callum Wilson Ryan Fraser and Miguel Almiron are Starting for our one and only Mighty Toon Army 12:30PM VS Everton Away at Goodson Park on BT Sports but Hopefully we see our other main man/ Match Winner coming off the Bench in the Second Half Allan Saint Maximin HWTL Forever And Always UP The Mighty Mags For Life ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Why is Clark not in defence this is a must if fit ??
Why is maxim not playing instead of shelvey or hendrick with Hayden in there
Why is dubravka not given a game
This is an absolute joke he cannot be listening to anyone why employ staff who cannot do their job
I give up honestly",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Do you think Bruce realizes that getting this new coach in has put him in a no win situation? (Not that winning is a thing he does). If we win, new guy can take the credit. If we keep losing, Bruce is out.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
How many more games do we have to lose before he is sacked? He is just not up to the task.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
What‚Äôs the odds on 12 without a win and Bruce still in a job,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Why Matty is not in is beyond me... Shelvey actually shows up for a half but to me that isnt enough to justify his general lack of effort. Hendricks is a ghost, id rather the two Longstaffs. Hayden is actually decent on the ball, a waste so deep. Clark should be in.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"A don‚Äôt get why Hayden is centre half he‚Äôs been one of our most consistent players if there is any gives us strength in midfield compared to hendrick and shelvey they get bossed every weekend, ano we‚Äôve got injuries but if Clark is on the bench get him on",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"He needs to take Darlow out of that goal or we will never win a game, dubravka a must better keeper and we are better defensively with him in goal as well",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Newcastle United by the time the ‚Äúsale ‚Äú of club goes through or even materialise‚Äôs we will be in league 1 , same team for weeks and we keep getting thrashed ! Is anyone at this club watching these games ??? You as a club from top too bottom are making a laughing stock out of us as supporters! When covid is over don‚Äôt be surprised if SJP is empty!!! You brought this on yourselves!!!",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Lascelles our worst centre back over Clark probably our best centre half,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Yes we are not the best squad, but I‚Äôm so pleased that all of you doubters on here have been proved wrong.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Not a Newcastle fan but Steve Bruce needs to go otherwise I can't see anything but relegation, Newcastle are a big team and should be in the premiership.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Doesn't really matter what side is put out, same people will complain either way. üò¥üò¥ Boring. We don't, all of a sudden have a new squad of players.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Looks as though Toon have found a good coach, well done Bruce.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Darlow has made enough mistakes last 2 3 games and should be dropped Dubravka should be back to number 1,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Playing with ten men again by starting Hendrick can he not see he offers absolutely nothing,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Why not play players in their proper positions. 5 at the back defend defend concede then try and play when it's already game over.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Hope this is steve Bruce's last game in charge how does he think setting up like that with almost the same players as always will work the guys a clown and acts like a big baby in interviews worst gaffer of my lifetime that's for sure,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"4231
Dubravka
Manquillo Schar Clark Lewis
Hayden Shelvey
Fraser Miggy ASM
Wilson
That‚Äôs my ideal lineup and formation",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Are people for real about darlow?! Hands down our player for the season! Dubravka possibly the better keeper overall but if anyone deserves to keep his place its darlow. In no way is he responsible for the state we are in,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Strap yourselves in for another swashbuckling 90 minutes from our dynamic duo of Shelvey and Hendrick.,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Why ü§£ surely are best line up would be:
Darlow
Manquillo schar lascelles Clark
Hayden shelvey
Fraser Almiron saint- maximin
Wilson
Or replace shelvey with matty long staff as shelvey has been poor lately and moves like a bus ü§£",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Has he learned nothing from that 2nd half he raved so much about ffs,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
I hope Hendricks forgotten his invisibility cloak today the cheeky little Potter,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
How are shelvey and hendrick still getting a start?! They‚Äôve been horrendous every week!,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Honestly. Bruce is amazing.... ""gloves are off"" he said..... thr only hope we have is waiting for ASM to step on the pitch.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
What does Hendrick hold over cabbage heed to get in the team üò°,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Why is hendrick starting?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Can we try shar in the middle field ?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Why is Hendrick in the side at all?,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"If it doesn't work,don't try to fix it.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Clark at CB move Hayden to midfield with Longstaff, get Shelvey and Hendrick out of the team",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"How does Lewis/shelvey/
Hendrick keep getting picked? Clark should be in at CB and move Hayden to CM and get rid of hendrick. Maximin mustn‚Äôt be fully fit yet then üò≥",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Good to see the club has actioned measures for Joelinton for breaking covid rules , are and by the way your in the squad today ü§¶",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2
Another team sent out together behind the ball and defend with your life Chance of a goal for us today none unfortunately I predict 3-0 Everton I pray I am wrong,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2

"I‚Äôd go with a 4-2-3-1 with this team:
Darlow
Yedlin Schar Clark Ritchie
M. Longstaff Hayden
Murphy Saint-Maximin Fraser
Wilson

I tried to pick the team based on who was available or I believed was before they posted the team and on performances throughout the season.

Definitely drop Lascelles as keeps losing possession too much recently and Shelvey too, one good performance against Leeds doesn‚Äôt make up for the rest of the season. Since Ritchie ain‚Äôt in the squad not sure who I‚Äôd bring in for him at LB.",205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2

You can only pray thats a 4 3 3 but we all know Hayden is playing CB so be a 541. 25% possession and a comfortable win for Everton,205,Everton,Newcastle,Away,-2

"Some of y'all City fans don't understand football, that's why you keep on blabbing about who should play and who shouldn't. It's important for there to be a rotation of players in the team, at least we bought them, everyone needs game time. So stop looking for Gundogan and Stones, they aren't machines, they need rest too. What happens when they get injured? (Gundogan already)

Just chill and have faith in all our players. Most important thing is to win regardless who plays, gets substituted or benched. Sure some players are better than others but they aren't going to play all the time, just take a look at what happened to Kevin.

I'm pretty sure you thought we'd lose a strong force in the midfield but other players stepped up and played beautiful football. And ffs stop bashing Mahrez, I too get sick of his singular type of play, but I'm confident he'd get better. When he starts getting better, you'd be the same ones to start praising him.

And lastly this isn't MyClub on PES or Ultimate team on FIFA. This is real football, lots of factors go into the game.",155,Everton,Man City,Away,-2

Can we take down all the posts about last nights game please and let us grieve in peace. I'm running out of paper hankies.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
Well certainly Longstaffe did not look fresh lost the ball on countless occasions and was responsible for Leeds getting at least three of their goals! Oh and did anyone notice we were ok at 2-2 then our coach decided to freshen things up then in a blink of an eye we were 5-2 behind! Awaiting our coaches response and also the fact we did not match their intensity as we know how they play ....pity our coaching staff did not realise that!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
"We were very poor tonight! How Sean longstaff gets a game is a joke, he was at fault for 2 or 3 of there goals. To slow, not the correct decisions made.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
"Lewis can't defend runs about a lot bur no defesive qualities.

Not good enough just being able to put a good cross in!",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
Stop playing Jacob Murphy be us useless!!! Let's see Joelington get a hat trick today he needs the boost. Hopefully a comfortable 3 points ‚úä,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
"Good line up with rotation in mind and we play again on saturday, leeds will continue to hit us so need to be solid , with this formation it limits the space they can play in to",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
I‚Äôd like to see joe on the left with Wilson in middle and Gayle on right with a midfield of Miggy and Fraser on left and right and longstaff in the middle,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
I like the look of this team to be honest. Only way to beat leeds is with width. Get around them to by line and easy taps in.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
Sensible lineup considering we just played Saturday and still have 5 games to play this month when a few have just come back from layoffs. Expect Wilson to be rested for 1 or 2 of the games remaining this month as well.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
Hendricks should not be playing he is horrendous worst player we‚Äôve got. I hope Lewis plays better than his last game,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
"Great idea Bruce, fielding Hendrick who has practically done f... All, all season, that's handing Leeds 3 points right there.

Think there will be more action watching the news then watching the garbage brucie has in hendrix and longstanding.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
"Understand the rotation, but not the formation. 5 at the back against a newly promoted team. I know there decent like but we are above them",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
Dropping almiron for Hendrick is a classic Bruce tactic. Awful decision! Useless clown!!,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3

"Why is a our fanbase so clueless at times? We can't play the same 11 every week! We moan when he plays players too often and they get injured, we moan when he rotates. He has obviously opted for 3 Centre backs as Leeds are awful on set pieces so he has extra height to exploit this as it'll be our best chance of scoring.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
I understand this line up rotation and covid. Just want to see a bit of possession and attack..... Strong bench to keep the attack up last 20 mins.... Apart from Lewis I'm happy.... Hendrick has to put in a good shift,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
We Should have Started Miguel Almiron Jonjo Shelvey and Matt Ritchie but Leave Jeff Hendrick on the Substitutes Bench but the rest of Wor Team is very good 1-2 Away Win for our Mighty Toon Army Callum Wilson and Dwight Gayle off the Bench HWTL Forever And Allways UP The Mighty Mags For Life,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
"Not too bad a lineup keeping people fresh etc. Wish Murphy played as winger but he does a good job last time round. My only worry is Hendrick and Seany both do CDM and not go as forward but we will see how it plays out.

Keep in mind Leeds are an all out attack team so have to counter that see if they tire by half time then go offensive.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
I know I'll probably get a lot of hate for this comment but I think we will win tonight I actually have some faith unlike everyone else. Get behind the team and support them ffs,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of this lineup but I am a fan of Brucey so let‚Äôs hope he has some tricks up his sleeve.,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
"Don't think Bruce had any other choice than to shuffle the pack but it just highlights our lack of quality in the squad as a whole, especially in the centre of midfield.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
I complained how Bruce left Lejuene career in tatters by overplaying him after long injury. I'm happy to see some rotation regardless of what I think of some of the players,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
Surely shelvey must be injured how can he pick hendrick over him. Wouldnt of dropped miggy after the last game either,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
Again Bruce shows he hasn't a clue.been luckier in the last few games then a gypsys lucky charm,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
"3 games in a week, that's why he's shuffled the pack. The days of picking your best 11 are gone. Time for Hendricks to show us if he's good enough.",124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
Bench looks better than most of the starting eleven! üòÇ,124,Leeds,Newcastle,Away,3
This is going to be a challenging game but I am confident we should pull out all stops and win. Leeds are very attacking minded and with our pace on the wings we should counter attack really well. All the best. Let's get 3 pointsüòé,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0
"I like the team selection today. Leeds play a high line.

"Well this is a counter attacking lineup. Iam not impressed. So we expected to let leeds have the possession and try catching them on breaks.. I mean this is man united.

Why put Cavan and Pogba on bench...am so disappointed in you...#Ole out,324,Leeds,Man Utd,Away,0

Oh no! Where is pogba? Where is Cavani? Is it because pogba too weak from fasting? Why Cavani out? He's top form. Looks like Degea will leave the club. Henderson is not in the league of Degea.

Bring Henderson back to the midfield. Concerned Manchester United fan.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
I wish he would have put Philips at the back and pushed Henderson up and left Milner on the bench,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Why did we sign Ben Davies? So fed up of our best midfielders playing centre back,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Was hoping to see Kabak and Nat Phillips in defence with Hendo back in midfield . Sooner we do that we can open teams up,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Tsimkas on bench he's able to play CB beside kabak so Hendo gini and Jones play midfield. He has to at some point throw these boys in the deep end what have we to lose now? Our best attack options needed more now and we're giving that up for the back line. ü§î,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"I thought klopp loved his young players he gave trent the chance when Clyne was injured and got Robertson in whys he not giving Philips the same run, Milner has done nothing in his last two games put hendo in midfield n natt in defence",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Love all the experts on here who know better than Klopp. Maybe the boss knows a bit more than you. Support your team.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"You know there‚Äôs a big issue with the team when there is not one striker on the bench... need to pull money out of our pockets and sell players like origi, gini, shaq, and then buy another forward and creative midfielder! Compare our bench to the likes of Man City, man united, it‚Äôs very poor! During a game when we are under performing there isn‚Äôt one player on the bench who I believe can turn around a game! Hopefully we have the money in the summer to rebuild, asking too much of our players to compete with other teams bringing on the likes of ageuro, cavani and so on! Need jota to return ASAP too!

Good to see the new CB starting! Though Wld of like to see Phillips start at back aswell and Hendo in midfield! Come on REDMEN let's get the win üòÅ,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Phillips is a good CB he should be utilized and put back the midfield maestro captain Hendo back on his position ...GooD luck Reds,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
With henderson at the back ... we conceded 4 against city ... am sure it wudn have been worse with Nat partnering Kabak ... but well what do i know ...Gaffer knows best .... that midfield is going to again make our blood boil üòÇ,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Why is Hendo in defense again?!!! Klopp has decided AGAIN to weekend two sections of the team. We NEED to play our strongest available midfield and protect the make shift defense, atleast we would only have one weakened section and not two. Why is Nat Phillips not playing? Hes done nothing wrong. Klopp is starting to wind me up. Today will be another loss or draw at best. Cant see a win here.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Still Henderson in defence, its not working he does an okay job much much better utalised in mid where he can drive the team.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Let‚Äôs hope the back line holds. Henderson belongs in the midfield, taking charge.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"This is an insult to N. PHILIPS who has been playing good whenever called upon, why dropping him just to play Henderson in Center back which has not been working out of recent.
This will do his (Philip) confidence no good.
Good luck to Kabak on his debut",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Great line up..looks solid in defense.. Great from klopp to give our news boy early chance to prove himself... Little sneaky move and creativity can easily lead us to win.. Expected big shaq in midfield tho...Best of luck YNWA,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Good line up but no creativity in the middle. Klopp has no other option in terms of selection as we can see our bench has no depth and no player who can turn the game around. Thiago is a good player but since has come in the middle we have slowed down our game. We have lost that intensity from the middle and front 3 are not firing because we have not been creating chances for them and that puts our defence on immense pressure. I still believe our players are giving their best.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Bad bench if need to change things up front. Also agree with 99.9% of everyones elses thoughts that Hendo should be in midfield.... I think Covid-19 lockdown has messed with Klopps head,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Great for the introduction of Ozan Kabak, but where is Ben Davies. Hendo at the back again instead of Midfield. Let's see how this game turns out at the time",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Milner and Jones
What a Joke
And why did we buy Davies
Hendo should return in the middle
Phillips is performing",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Omg . Milner instead of Tiago. Hendo in defence while Philips on the bench. I give up. Why is Klopp so stubborn. Hope I‚Äôm wrong. Come on the pool.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Hendo seriously needs to be in Midfield! Should of put Phillips at the back and Hendo for Milner,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Well I‚Äôm pleased one of our new centre backs is starting but still Hendo is in defence and why sign Ben Davies and not start with him in 2 matches in a row?,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Before anyone kicks off he's had to put Hendo CB with Fabinho ruled out get off his case and get behind the team up the Redmen!,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
just seen the lineup and Hendo looks like he's playing in defence. I hope we win but can't see it. That midfield is going to provide zero creativity. We will have the majority of possession but will play with fear. I love to see the shackles come and the players take some risks,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
I love Milner and he‚Äôs been a great servant but he shouldn‚Äôt be starting in midfield for us. At his age he should be getting brought on with 20 minutes to go to sure things up....,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"What's wrong with Klopp?

Play either Rhys or Philips alongside Kabak and put Henderson in the midfield where he is more efficient.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Klopp still can't learn his lessons, Hendo in the CB when 2 CB are on the bench and weak midfield again?

Anyway hope it won't end in tears",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
No davies in squad again don't know why he bought him üòë,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"You people who are complaining about this line, need to understand that Kabak cant play with Philips he needs guidance that why Hendo is play, Milner is playing because of late Thiago has picked up alot of cards",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Weak midfiled could of at least pushed hendo into midfiled and started Phillips with kabak and why bench thiago,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"I would have played Hendo in midfield and Phillips as CB, but I guess the gaffer knows what he‚Äòs doing, and maybe two inexperienced CBs against Leicester would have been too much of a risk. I‚Äòm just worried about a lack of creativity in midfield.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Thiago to come on in the second half and pick them apart once wijnaldum and Milner have worn down their midfield üíØ,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Why not play kabak and Phillip at the back. And move the captain to the midfield, what do Philip have to do to earn klopps trust ü§¶.. I hope we win ..+3 points #YNWA",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Still playing midfielders at centre back... Seems to me Klopp wants out. Henderson is needed in midfield.

Never understand his thinking, becoming very stubborn, and I'm losing faith in him in the process. This hasn't worked for 2 months, why does he think it's going to work now?!

Nevermind, the one trick pony will blame Brexit or something if we lose again today.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Gini made the squadüò° hendo at the back AGAINüò° if we didn‚Äôt have any trust in our signings then don‚Äôt buy them,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Why not start Hendo in midfield ? And philips or davies with kabak. I just don't get his team selection. Its because of this we are losing games and not scoring. Not just the injuries.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Good to see Jones being given the responsibility to be the creative midfielder. Assuming he isn't pushing Gini further forward like in the Dutch team. Jones' accelerated development might just be the best thing to come out of this season.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Would love to know why I‚Äôm about to sit and watch arguably our best midfielder in Henderson play CB again. Davies should be playing alongside Kabak can‚Äôt be any worse than what we‚Äôve shown in the last several games defensively that midfield 3 is too bland no game changes there but hopefully things will click YNWA üî¥,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Can‚Äôt do it this year. Just concentrate on Champions League and win that big trophy again to have some redemption this this season,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Another loss, Hendo should be in midfield, instead we have no creative spark... 3-0 Leicester Vardy gonna have a fun day",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Cant play Milner and Gini together in midfield it never works,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Rather have Phillips with Kabak and put Hendo where he belongs,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Henderson in defence again, just play philips and move henderson into midfield ü§¶",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Why push hendo at the back again,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Why is Hendo at the back again. It thought that is why we went and got 2 CBs. He belongs in Midfield.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Good line up hope we win.... Where is Ben Davis? I also prefer Philips for that center of defense, so that Henderson will go back to midfield... All the same, best of luck#ynwa",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Is Davies injured?? Should be Phillips and Kabak at centre back and move Hendo into midfield which has been poor lately. Klopp is pissing me off playing Hendo in defence again ffs.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
What was the point in signing Davis ? The lad must be devastated. I would played ox for the power in midfield and he‚Äôs more likely to score,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
We need hendo in midfield both for his quality and leadership within that unit - give Davies a go he seems mature and ready to the task - kabak no good tonight but he‚Äôs a young player with potential stick by him YNWA,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
If Liverpool ever need a new manager there are loads on here who know better than Klopp. After all what has Klopp ever won.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
It‚Äôs a shame it took an injury crisis in defence for the rest of the world to realise just how valuable Henderson is to the team and get the respect he deserves,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Delighted to see Kabak starts today. But Henderson should be back in the midfield I think. I no longer trust Milner in Midfield anymore, he's not that creative and technical midfielder we need.
Anyway, all the best boys!
#YNWA",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Definitely need hendo and fab back in midfield getting hold of the game were loosing games anyway so play the strongest midfield and play your actual defenders in defence,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
I feel desperately sad for our team at the moment. So many of them are out of touch and inconsistent. With our defensive problems we need to score more goals than the opposing team. We can do that with a strong midfield with Hendo there directing operations. Bring back Philips to play alongside Kabak or one of the other defenders we have on the bench and release our best midfielders. Just a thought!,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"I thought that with the signings we could use Nat and Kabak/Davies so as to push our midfielders back in their positions ,but we trust in Klopp and I think today is going to be a good day for the lads YNWAüî¥",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Im busting for hendo in midfield too but with this being Kabaks first game in a new league there is noone better to communicate and settle him through it than hendo beside him who is vocal for 90 mins. Cant wait for hendo in midfield tho as I feel thiago will benefit from it so much.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
The bench is still poor for a club of Liverpool's stature,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Is anyone noticing that since Thiago joined and took over Hendo in the middle we lost our attacking and defending strength??!!,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Buy 2 centre backs and still have Hendo back there? Leicester win this, and with ease",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Totally agree with most on here.
Get Henderson back in midfield.
Need to make a change.
Wise up Jurgen.. it's not working",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Unfortunately playing safe is not winning games! We need to take our chances in defence and get hendo back into midfield,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
I just want to understand who‚Äôs the defensive midfielder in this lineup? Who will shield to the defence & commit fouls in counter attack ? Neither Jni nor Milner can do that role probably. We‚Äôll end up with a hole in our midfield and weak link between defence & attack. Klopp every match get on my nerve really. He got a lot of other options but he insists on picking the osing formula ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"If ever there was an indictment of what klopp thinks of Phillips Davies and Williams, it‚Äôs this lineup.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Time to see if they‚Äôre all talk and little action or whether we turn up and are bang at it.... Curtis Jones needs to back his statement up! Time to go at a team and not fanny about ‚Äúkeeping possession‚Äù and ruining everything we‚Äôre good at.

Let‚Äôs go!! ü§ûüí™",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Why did klopp move hendo to midfield and bring nat philips is a mystery. Come on guys a win is a must to bring us in full confidence before the CL.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Good to see Thiago dropped, needs to understand the philosophy a bit more rather than slowing it all up and picking up needless bookings. Get Trent back up and running by using Milner in there might give us some impetus to deliver in the box rather than pass it all the way and then turn around and start again.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Come on guys!
Was hoping both Ben Davies and Kabak at the back with Hendo back bossing it in midfield. Hope Milner gets back to his previous levels, against Brighton it was painful watching him struggle.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Klopp is repeating the same mistake. Hendo should return back to the midfield. If he doesn't trust the defenders he bought then why buy them in the first place? If he is scared of mistakes, are the older and regular players not making mistakes? Moreover we learn from our mistakes. These guys need to start growing in confidence and it can only come from playing regularly.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"A bit worried with that midfield combination, only jones got some creativity",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Why is klopp doing this? Henderson should get back in the midfiled, philips and davies could have taken up that spot",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Henderson needs to be back in the midfield. Phillips should be in defence.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Why no Nat? .my opinion the boy has done nothing wrong and hendo needs to back in midfield,hate to say it no change from the previous line up from midfield onwards.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Listen, we are in a poor run of form at the moment but if this strangest of seasons has taught us anything its that results can turn quickly and league positions change massively in a short space of time. Only hard work and belief will move this team back up the table. Be a believer. YNWA.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Emotions aside, it seems Klopp wants to go out. He is repeatimg same things again and again.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Front 3 will struggle with that midfield,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Henderson at the back again, against Vardys pace. He would be better risking Davies and defending from the middle of the park with JH there.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Ozan Kabak deserves to play in Liverpool with his age and progress, and when he takes the necessary time, he is a football player with the capacity to be a Liverpool legend in the future. Good luck Ozan Kabak",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Need more creativity in cm, milner should be in bench henderson in middle and Nat phillips at back with one of new lads",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Sadly no matter what team selection he makes it will be wrong. He has no choice with Fabinho not able to play - either back or centre. His job is certainly not easy right now so give Jurgen a break!!!,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
People dont half moan! Think ur all forgetting 1 thing...klopp sees these lads train everyday. He knows whos on form and who isnt and picks his squad on it. All supporters do i slate his decisions!,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"There is no a difference the fact that Hendo is still at CB, obviously Ozan was the only option.. why not play Davies or Phillips along side him? What difference did Klopp made from the team that have been performing very poor??? Maybe we will be lucky to win",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Midfield is gonna struggle abit with Milner and Gini together. Inclusion of Jones is fine but Hendo needs to be back in midfield. However, never doubt the ability of these players, they will do well anyway! üôÇ",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Great to see Kabak in Nd Thiago on the bench. Hopefully we‚Äôll have more ambition in midfield. Will take time to replace both CBs but this is one step forwards to getting Hendo back in the middle. ü§û for a great performance! YNWA,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Mmmm here we go again. Imo. The first half would be scoreless again both team reading each others play or enforcing their way on each others defense. And the second half Thiago would come for fresh legs 8n the midfield. But either way i hope whatever klopps plan would be a success,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"I like the line up, seen a lot of comments wanting hendo back in midfield couldn‚Äôt agree more. Maybe the logic by behind Kloop thinking is that hendo got that range of passing and he know our system and that quick counter. Kloop we trust.YNWA",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Nat Phillips played well , Tsimikas neefs to be given chance and Hendo must move to midfield as soon as possible.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Good to see klopp getting his senses back and playing a real defender and for also giving Thiago a well deserved rest probably because he want to up the tempo of games.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Our defence really sacks especially Kabak it doesn't fit to Liverpool squad right now,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
I don't understand why Tsimkas was brought and still hasn't been used when we're lacking in our defence! How can these boys get game time if Henderson and Milner are given the role of CB,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"We bought defenders, so why is hendo still in defense, same old same the front three will get no service, without hendo in the middle, why isnt Davis playing, pisses me off.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
I am sure that Ozan Kabak will play without any fault. He will do it perfectly. üëç,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Thats the best CB pairing under the circumstances. Anyone that thinks Philips should be pairing Kabak up against Leicester needs a reality check,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Why did he buy 2 defenders ,put them on push hendo up and give it a go",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
My fears of not starting Hendo in midfield have been realised. Why oh why doesn't Klopp see that. After a going 1 nil up capitulating now. Mistakes will happen if you don't pick the right players in their right positions. Its asking the opposition to come at you. And the front 3 arn't firing because of that.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Either Liverpool or Klopp, one may eventually destroy the other. Play Centre backs in the rightful position, and the midfielders where they can thrive better.",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Stop putting hendo in defence , he's needed in midfield , play nat Phillips along side kabak",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Y our skipper play that position again while we still got ben davies? Hendo can play DM and jones as a sub..ah come on..üòì,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Shame no hendo in midfield. Davies injured as not even on bench vs William's. If we go behind hope klopp takes risk to change centre defence and put hendo into midfield . Right move to drop thiago . Jones has to step up. Ynwa,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Feel sorry for Nat tbh not sure what he has done wrong. Hope Kabak is tatically ready for such a big game and the way we play out from the back. Vardy will be licking his lips today we gotta be ready. Good luck fellas,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Our back 4 and keeper will be under tremendous pressure today because this midfield will spend 80% of their time passing backwards and sideways and Leicester will press hard. The midfield does not suggest an attacking team at all. Phillips is experienced enough now to free up Henderson for midfield surely. Him alongside Thiago and Gini/Ox/Shaq would have been a better set up.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Maybe the boss should consider benching one of our front 3 each time then gluing them together in the 2nd half to have a greater impact when the opposition is tired,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Good luck to Ozan Kabak on his debut for the reds!,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
got nothing to lose to obviously rather have fabinho bck or Hendo back in midfield aim now top 4 unfortunately next season need clear out fringe player def need few more players same team for last 3 years hopefully jota bck soon if gini go no lost origi as well milner serve club well shaquri as well,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
L FC will be very lucky to grind a result from this match the injuries are just too many....it's gonna be a very long bumpy season for usYNWA,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Don‚Äôt get it at all get your best midfielder back in midfield and play centre backs you have and have some balance,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
So we buy 2 CB so now we have 4 fit CB and we still play a midfielder and important midfielder who dictates our pace and speed of play I have stopped being surprised now this season is turning into a joke,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Oh ffs. I love the reds but come on... pit Nat Phillips in alongside Kabak and let Hendo get back to midfield where we need him.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"Midfield way to static, hopefully Jones provides more killer passes instead of slowing the game down the entire time",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
"What the f... is up with our benchüò¨ Milner starting & a full back 4 on the bench (not including a new signing ü§î). If we need to change it up attacking wise, not much there üò≥",236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Oh no Milner and wijnaldum in midfield both so slow and unproductive- Milner over the hill and gini is still trying to get up the hill - they won't provide any bullets for the front three and where's Phillips our best defender in the last three games. Hendo wasted at back- he won't catch vardy just like he couldn't catch foden !!!,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Jones goin to have a great game today. He is key to linking the front 3 which we have struggled with when starting milner wijnaldum and thiago.,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
For crying out loud we have 2 center backs on the bench why is hendo in center defence ??,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Another frustrating 45 minutes. All the ball no clear cut chances again. Leicester have had 2-3 very good chances. This pattern is becoming all to frequent.....,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Ermm. Hnendtly to say. Jones was the one playing well in midfield among the 3 of them. Last game after klopp subbed him out we can't even play in the midfield. Same goes to this game. I wonder why Klopp always sub him out. Fitness maybe?,236,Leicester,Liverpool,Away,2
Are we resting our in-form players for champions league next week? I understand there's international break next week so why the need to bench Saka and Aubameyang? I pray we get all the 3 points though,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Wasting Martinelli‚Äôs development for Willian who‚Äôs no better nice,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"We have nothing to fight for in the EPL again,so the EL is our only hope if we‚Äôre to play in Europe next season.
But Martinelli deserves some playing time.",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"What do you mean by Laca captains the side? Give Xhaka back his handband please, one misbehaviour is not enough, we all make mistakes, he has not only learnt from his error but he has massively improved. Saka aside, Xhaka is our second most valuable player going by perfomance and consistency. The guy is our true captain, a natural leader on the pitch. I pray we all see this.",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"I get resting players, but the Xhaka X Elneny experiment in midfield just doesn‚Äôt work. Keep Partey back by all means, but surely (even after his disasterclass midweek) Ceballos has to go in ahead of Elneny...?",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"I have faith that we shall win.All these criticisms wouldn't change anything at the moment.
The Gunners will pull a remarkable win today.",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Resting our best players at this moment isn't as much important as playing them. We need this 3 points. Anyway, let's hope they play well and deliver the results.",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Best formation whole season.. 10 to 14 placing is a confirmed.. sorry to say this. Just hope they press leicester city or a change in 2nd half. Gd luck.,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Oh xhaka needs some rest too he has played so many games and at the end of the day guys will continue to criticize him,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Shocking man management from Arteta. Starting Willian ahead of Martinelli is a crime. He has blood in his hands. #COYG,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
My only concern is Elneny if he can pass the ball more to the front and not left right back.... Pick those runs from Pepe and Williams... Good luck üî¥‚ö™,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
You don't have any right to bench our best player so far! Saka should start every gameüôÑ,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"I guess Arteta doesn't want a predictable line up by Leicester...loo
ks tactical to me....good luck boys!",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Unbelievable 11th in the league playing a team who‚Äôs 15 points in front off us and goes with this team defeat before the game starts hopefully I‚Äôm wrong thoughü§ûü§û,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Rotate players for what!!!! Some of us go to work from Monday to Saturday and nobody rests us! This is what they are paid to do!! Arteta, our glory will come back by winning EPL matches and not any other!!! Martinelli, Auba, Partey, SaKa, Od starting on the bench!!! Nonsense.",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"I struggle to understand how Willian starts when a fit Martinelli is available.
The process under Arteta, just destroying a young talent with hunger to win.
Anyway, I hope we win.",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"We are having a strong bench than starting eleven, all the best lads",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"We went full strength against Man City
when there was no hope of beating them
at all but today we rest 6 players all at
once against Leicester who we had a
chance to beat.
F***k this management, embarrassing
absolutely embarrassing.",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Is Martinelli the new Ozil as he never likes to play him . I have no respect for Arteta,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Fine if Arteta wants to prioritize the EL over PL but Willian before Martinelli...oh
come on!",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Its a doomed line up . we losing the game to Leicester .Wilian is useless player costing our team so much,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Obviously don‚Äôt fancy winning this game then üôÑ. Xhaka and Elneny on the pitch together is a disaster waiting to happen and they only move the ball sideways and backwards. I get Saka needs a rest but he is one of only a few players who looks to actually make things happen,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Arteta deserves to coach Southampton not arsenal. In arsenal there's no space for willian. And why do you leave our best defender holding on bench for the pair of snails to start in central defense. Arteta must be sacked.,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Oh pliz enough of the tantrum s if your not comfortable with the selection. You can loan yourselves to our noisy neighbours. We are the GUNNERS no matter what team or who the coach is. Let's just suport our boys for good results,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Good squad rotation.
Honestly we have nothing to play for in the league.
Let's put all our focus on winning the Europa League.",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"Come on lads.
It's Leicester city for God's sake, they're not a match.. we can persecute it with an understrength team and still win the match.

The guys need a break.
Most importantly, trust in the process ‚úäüèΩ",255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
All our best players on the bench!!! Wtf???,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Thought we'd field a stronger starting lineup against Leicester... going to be a tough game... coyg!,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Just because Willian gave a lucky assist he starts todayü§£ü§£,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
Got more chance of a Willian hat trick than an arsenal win today.,255,Leicester,Arsenal,Away,-2
"No problems with the line up except Krafth, can‚Äôt stand him. Has a club foot and far too slow to be a wing back. Why is Clark on the bench?
As for the result, I think a draw is all we can hope for in this game. Have to do WAY better than we did against Arsenal, but Leicester are a very good side. Don‚Äôt see us winning this one.",345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2
Not bad but how the hell does Krafth get in there ?,345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Manager of the month nomination seems to have slightly confused him,",345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Krafth!!! Possibly the worst player in the league man. I know we have to be positive but don‚Äôt see that decision.
Anything from this game will be fantastic. Leicester can be hit or miss so let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs the latter.

Hope we keep the lead at 90 minutes and Burnley beat Fulham on Monday to be safe for another season.

Steve Bruce STILL NEEDS to go though.",345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2
If anyone could explain to me how krafth gets a game ahead of Clark that would be great ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2
Kraft at centre half is a risk. Am delighted to see Joe willock back in the team and maximum and Wilson staring together. I would of played Clark infront of kraft that could be a worry.,345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2
We have the players to really go for it. Glad to see that finally happen for both halves of a game. HWTL. Best game I‚Äôve seen us play in ages!,345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2
"Krafth is a total liability and Clark would of been a better and more safer option, Willock had to come back in, rest of the team as expected",345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2
Clark for kraft and it would pretty much be our best team,345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2
Actually loving this line up apart from krafth. Would of preferred Clark over him. We need these points lads ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è,345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2

How can people say it‚Äôs a decent line up with Shelvey and Krafth üôÑ,345,Leicester,Newcastle,Away,-2

Excellent selection . Firing from all angles is my expectation. Sheffield will beg us to stop scoring today,56,Liverpool,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"This season could be a battle of wits of the managers. Results are far from what we anticipated. My personal opinion, big time players for the big games are missing the fans while the pretenders are striving without the pressure and nerve wrecking atmosphere.

So good luck for the guys and Mr. Klopp - just give your best and you will make us happy and proud...",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I expected to see any of Henderson or Fabinho in Midfield by having Kabak to partner at the back. Anyway, still a good decision. Goodluck! #YNWA",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"It‚Äòs incredible that our best Centre Back Nat Phillips is on the bench!!! We‚Äòll miss his amazing passing and the tackles which are flat out amazing!!!
Come On Nat!üôå",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Not convinced with the line up..seeing Jones start doesn't fill me with confidence..als
o henderson back centre back is a little disapointing",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I get the new boys aren‚Äôt in due to 1 training session but with hendo and fab in the back we are goosed, we need control in that midfield and would have that with fab and hendo up there, put the new boys in, 2 good cb and what better game to give them PL feel and a desire to prove themselves",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I love our boss, but it seems that he has a mental block @ the moment. What's the point in buying central defenders if your not going to use them. Henderson should be back in Midfield were he can affect the game more. We will never retain the title if he keeps playing in central of defence.",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I love these players in our squad but a lot of them just don‚Äôt cut it for this club, firmino isn‚Äôt good enough, salah in my opinion is over rated, Trent cannot defend to save his life and there is not enough depth and good players on the bench. Why play Fabinho and Henderson at the back when we have kabak and Phillips and defenders for to play? The attacking 3 aren‚Äôt as electric as they were a couple of seasons ago; not making runs in behind, not pressing like they used to and all 3 of them have a poor 1st touch, the ball is always stuck under their feet so they lose the ball or play a stupid pass due to their 1st touch. We need more players in the summer",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Klopp is just overwhelmed by the fear of the unknown. Why play Nat Phillips on the bench while he has proven himself time and again? That mid without Hendo is just a done deal. Let's focus on the next game as we always have been told to do.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I also don't think not playing the new defenders is a great Idea but
Klopp you the Boss
All the Best My Team",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
kabak should have started and hendo needed to be moved to center midfield..yet that's a good looking starting lineup with experienced players..happy to see mane back to his reigned kingdom..we wanna see creativity in midfield and high press heavy metal football...but still we can only win if we can keep our defense line solid ...Goodluck reds..YNWA,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Y not play one of the new boys and play Henderson in his normal position where he commands and creates goals. He is doing the job in there but we need him in midfield when we have brought in 2 centre backs. The midfield wins games. Come on the boys!,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Could have put one proper CB with Fabino and put our hendo back to his position or put two proper CD and have hendo and Fabino to their respective positions that's when I know we can win a game,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Get two CB""s and can't seem to trust either... Hope we see one of them soon to release Hendo or Fab from these shackles..",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Take Jones out, move hendo into CM and put kabak at the back",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Totally understand why klopp hasn‚Äôt started the 2 new lads, we are playing the best team in the league at the moment, if the new lads make a mistake it could finish them before they have even started. Bring them in slowly under less pressure.",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
2 new defenders and playing our best midfielders at the back FFS. Conceding goals has not been an issue. Creating them has üò° our midfield is not strong enough.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Yeah we buy defenders but we wont play them. Instead we mess with the balance in the midfield so neither the defence nor midfield will work. Brilliant!,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Would of liked to see Kabak starting and to move hendo up to midfield..need to take a risk at this stage,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"If we lose today's game, the manager is 100% accountable. We would at least play kabak with Hendo at the back and then have Fabinho released back into the midfield",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Why can't he put one of the centre backs along side fab. Nat Phillips done well last few games frees Henderson to go in midfield then,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"should have kept Philips in and put Hendo back in his rightful position to drive the midfield! Just dont understand Klopps thinking at the moment. Apart from Spurs and West Ham games we have looked awful and struggled to score, ran out of ideas ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"They fear us more.... Let's do this! Our front 3 are always stimulated by the word ""Manchester"" üòâüòâ",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Me personally would of put Henderson in midfield to replace Jones and Phillips at centre back but let‚Äôs see how it pans out. We don‚Äôt have a much better team available still at the minute. Jota still a couple a weeks away desperate for him to come back.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Congratulations
to Man City...easy 3pts and a march to regaining your Title.
Klopp is really pissing me off. Playing our 2 best Holding midfielders in Center of defence. You now have 4 central defenders and you aren't going to play Any of them.
Had enough now",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Come in to see so many rants blah blah blah why sign Cb when we don‚Äôt play them blah blah blah. Cmon man let‚Äôs get behind the team. In Klopp we trust,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
What's with all the negative comments? Surely our best team to put out at this moment in time. Surely our new CBs need time to get into the flow of things so risking them in a game like this isn't a risk we should be taking. Let's hope Hendo and Fab can shut a few of you lot up. YNWA,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Ffs put one of the new defenders in defence!!!!!!,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Why bother signing defenders then stick to playing midfielders at the back the mind boggles üôàanyway obviously hope we win good luck,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Sorry but lessons not learned,we need our captain in midfield not central defense,Phillip
s has not let us down ,remember the good old days when it was a like for like change,now it's a couple if position changes accommodate one",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Why is Phillips not playing for 1 of Fabinho or Henderson to move back to the midfield. Sometimes I don't seem to understand the reason behind klopp selection. Phillips has been so good recently to be benched,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Best possible lineup... New defenders needs time to blend in.... YNWA,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Why sign two defenders and not play at least one of them??? Cannot understand that at all! We need control in midfield, I can‚Äôt see that happening with Jones in there!
Hope I‚Äôm wrong! Come on redmen üî¥",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I'm beginning to think that klopp is part of our problem, Henderson gives us the balance we need in the midfield.

Kabak/fabinho would've been the best for this game",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Unbelievable!!!
What‚Äôs the point buying defenders when not going bloody use them!!!
Need Henderson midfield!!!
Gobsmacked",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Why henderson on CB where's kabak,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"2 cbs on the bench? And 2 of our best midfielders in defence? Better win this kloppo.

2 creative passers at the back and 2 rampaging full backs. I'm not feeling confident for a result here",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Was hoping hendo at least would be back in midfield.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"What a joke buys 2 cb s and plays our best midfielders in there instead, gonna be a long afternoon",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"2 new cb‚Äôs and still putting our 2 best midfielders in defence, really?!

Surely at least leave Hendo in midfield and play Phillips or one of the new boys alongside Fab?!",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Can our plan B if things aren't going to plan today not be Origi for Firmino please...,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Klopp is very stubborn. Why did he even sign defenders?,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Kabak should at least be with fabinho so Hendo can go into the midfield.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Curtis Jones should not be starting and that‚Äôs a fact,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Just stick kabak in and play hendo where he's literally been one of the best for years,ah well up the reds",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Should have brought on Phillips,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Come on liverpool. You can do it!,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
We bought two defenders. Why ain‚Äôt one of them playing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Hendon should be back in the middle today,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Hendo as CB again? Come on klopp ü§∑,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Was going to have a rant but be wasting my time. Our 2 best midfielders at the back againüôÑüò°üò§,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
i realise our hands are tied a bit with injuries. but i really dont like the midfield. we are just lacking without hendo. its just not working with thigoa so far. no goals or assists. its been disappointing,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
We can‚Äôt even grow our youngsters because of lack of trust... while other big clubs got expensive youngsters.. imagine you‚Äôre a centre back but you can‚Äôt do your purpose and letting other positions taking your spot..,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Can't understand why he's not starting with Davies today. Hes played every game for PNE this season so he's fully fit. Yes, it's a step up for him but just play the lad and see if he's up to it. He's a calm headed guy I'm sure he would have been ok and we could have then moved Henderson in Midfield!",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
We need tried and tested players for this game. We can't risk playing defenders who have hardly a week training with the team. A lot is at stake here. YNWA.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"See Man city is a very good team on a great run of form. We could still lose if we had 7 van Dijks. Rather than bicker, let's hope Klopp gets it right and we win if not we brace the trolling on Monday.",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
I‚Äôm worried about Jones in that midfield city may take advantage with his lack of experience would of preferred Milner,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
What are we playing at. The midfield struggles without hendo and fab in there so we play them in defence against a team that loves to keep the ball in midfield? What is the point of the loan if we don‚Äôt play him?,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Would‚Äôve had a kabak and fabs pair up today with hendo back in mid, but we‚Äôll see what happens. Go red men",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"So lets go boys!We are here for you so do what you can!#!It's city no matter what form you have,how many match lost at anfield!It's now it's tonight,we believe you and we know that you can win itüí™‚úå
And the most important thing
You'll never walk alone",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
We need a win having same front 3 mane only one game out .Henderson needs to be up front more Jones playing don't agree with my opinion since palace game we lost our way lfc,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Does that mean Klopp doesn't have confidence in the boys he signed? With the time they have spent with the lads kabak should start the match even to boost his confidence so that hendo can come to his rightful position,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Kabak should of started leave Henderson in midfield they've been shambolic anyway what was there to lose,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Hopefully now the season is over he plays the 2 new defenders till the end of the season 2 give them a chance 2 bond for next season. If not then we may as well give em back. Simples,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Haha! Make shift defence again because Klopp has 0 trust in new players. My point made about not seeing them until April still stands. Ridiculous,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Why sign two centre backs and still keep playing Hendo in there!? Need him in midfield, the performances at home are evidence of that",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Play at least one new centerhalf and push up hendo into the middle, gave to change it up a bit",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Debut against City is high risk.
City will attack so Klopp has gone for safer options with Hendo and Fab at the back which is completely logical and understandable",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Can everyone chill out about the new defenders. They will play but it takes more than a few sessions to bed them into a side with the style of play we have.
Support the team or don‚Äôt bother watching. Thiago should get some space today and will hopefully pull the strings. YNWA",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Seeing line up like this make me wonder whether we r going to play against a serious title contender or carabao cup div 3 opponents..shou
ld start phillips instead..hopefu
lly this is another genius tact by klopp..",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I also think, like a lot of people, that we should have started with Kabak and allowed Hendo or Fab to control the midfield. But, Klopp is not stupid and we need to have faith.",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Disappointed Henderson in defence & not in midfield... Phillips deserves to keep his place,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Nats and Fabs at the back. The skip in place of Jones. Would be more structured and we cant have both Jones and Thiago in the team, they hold on to the ball to long. Please prove me wrong today Reds.
#YNWA",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Suprised none of the centre half not started.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"We have got 2 quality defenders and we are still playing hendo and fab in the back, only 1 of them needs to be there as long as they have 1 main squad defender like fab next to them we could start kabak with fab and Have hendo in the mid field",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Frankly hendo is n't old enough to play as central back, boss should use Phillips instead of hendo, i hope we will won and get the most important 3 points good luck boys",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I‚Äôm no manager by any stretch of imagination but I would throw Kabak in there, pair him with Fab. Seems with the injuries we have - with our current performances and with City‚Äôs current run, the league is almost as good as gone. So Klopp has nothing to lose here - just throw in the boy in the deep.",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Klopp is confused at the moment...why start Jones now and what the reason for buying two center backs if we don't play them.... Already loose the game!,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I would have started Ox instead of Curtis Jones, or Nat Phillips, and move Henderson to midfield. It's a good footballing line up though. Jones can provide cover when Trent goes forward. Same with Gini when Robertson goes forward. Have Thiago play behind the front three. üí™",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Don‚Äôt agree with the starting 11. But let‚Äôs see what happens.

Fabinho is not that great as CB. And against city he‚Äôs gonna suffer.

No surprises. Pep must be glad.

Nat Ph is on the bench...oh why?!!!",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"So we buy new defenders but we don't play them , We still use the same lineupü§î
Why not start our new defenders and give them a chance and put Henderson back in midfield in his normal position. That would make more sense then keeping our same line up we been using",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Fact is Thiago Alcantara has changed our pattern and need to sit out games to understand Liverpool more.
We will surely not do better with him in the starting lineup.
I hope we are able to scale through Man City though",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Why buy 2 cb who have been playing football all season and know how to play football and not play them! And have another cb who ever one was wanking over at the beginning off the season!! Klopp is a brilliant manager but today I have no words! Hendo needs to be in the midfield,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Why do you have to risk two midfielders when you have center backs on the bench üò° sometimes klopp makes drastic changes,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
He doesn't want to rush the defenders into big games so that if anything goes wrong they won't loose their confidence permanently,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
We are whipping City by 3 goals to nil! YNWA!,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"How many games do we have to wait to use one of the new CBS? You are putting your best two midfielders in the defensive position. Thiago, Gini and Jones can‚Äôt build up abs they are predictable based on the last 5 games. Let‚Äôs hope some magic happens and we win",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"People just shouting the 2 CB. So if you were the manager you just gonna throw them in, playing team like CIty. They need time to train with the team and know the style",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
What will it take for Klopp to trust Phillips at CB he on all the games he has played he has always been solid...... But he rather convert midfielders over him,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Philips benched after those valiant effort...... Henderson is needed in the mid....üòìüòìüòì,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I don‚Äôt understand ü§®. If playing both new defenders is too risky, at least play Phillips with one of them. It can always be adjusted ??? Anyway, hope we get the 3 points somehow . Ynwa.",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Hendo done well in defence with Fabino and curtis Jones is good player so who does not think so go and support some one else every one got on hendo back a while ago,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"To soon for the new defenders, need experienced players today with the knowledge of how city play, good line up and trust klopp",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I have my confidence in this team and the manager, we'll bounce back it might be a bit late for the little now but I have my belief. YNWA",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
cant wrap em up in cotton wool we bought defenders do a job should be ready professional players end of day klopp playing safe here,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Dam what the fok is klop thinking this is a easy win for man city with this starting line liverpool is going nowhere,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Klopp needs to trust other players.. we have messed up already because we gave no exposure to other players by playing same lineup match after match when everyone was fit.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"This is the strongest we have at the moment. They either deliver or fail.
Bring on the City lads, we show them what we are made of!

Jota is missing in action though",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Would've liked to have seen Kabak partner Fabhino in defence. Allowing Hendo Thiago and Curtis or Gini in midfield.
Then usual front three boys- Mo, Sadio, Bobby.
Whatever the case.... Come on you Reds. #in Klopp we trust",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
I think we can win with this line up.. good attacking midfield and all 3 forwards,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
At least one center back should be paired with Fab at defense to free Henderson to Midfield definitely would not start with Jones.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"I think milner would have been better than jones in the midfield, we need someone with a higher work rate",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
You know sometimes reality is real so according to my prediction klopp your defensive is weak & that's what makes you to be in high pressure on this game mancity is strongest in defensive and striking so looking on it much,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Could have also play Philip and move Henderson back to midfield. We need to win the battle at midfield to control the game and pace. Klopp is fearful. Think he playing it safe. This might be a draw or lost. City will overwhelmed Jones and Gini in the middle.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"the game hasn't even started yet and you have all already found a reason why we will lose... he has clearly put fabinho and hendo in defence as they are very experienced players, this is more important for this game",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Still concerned that as good as he is Thiago really slows the play down and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs impacting the front three. They need quick ball to play to their strengths.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Mistake is when you have two natural defenders on the bench and you play midfielders as defenders when facing the most attacking team!!!!! the Klopp decisions which are costing Liverpool.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Mane is back üòÅ go Reds I believe you'll do us good. But I would have preferred Henderson in place of Jones to push to midfield then introduce Kabak next to Fab. But I trust Klopp,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Some strong players there, which makes me suggest there's something going on behind the scenes I mean look at minamino at Southampton the other night on form from what I saw yet it seems he asked for a transfer away from Liverpool?!",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Wrong team. Needs Hendo in midfield. Same old.. same old get the same results.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"As best a first team as we could put out, but the bench looks very defensive and City's looks very strong and attacking so fingers crossed we go at them then use the subs to protect any lead üôè",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"The match has not been played yet , and all the armchair manager's have written us off get a grip. YNWA.",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
That would be my team except for Kabak in defence and Henderson in midfield instead of Jones. C'mon Redmen!!! üî¥ ‚öΩÔ∏è,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Sorry but red are tired. We need some new players. Teams in English leagues need to have at least two teams for competing. One for local leagues and other one for international competitions. I sorry to say that but our team doesn‚Äôt have to team and it‚Äôs difficult for us. YOU‚ÄôLL NEVER WALK ALONE,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Trent is really a bad defender. Don‚Äôt let Raheem get in on his right foot...he did that we conceded the penalty, yet it happened again for the goal. I think Klopp should consider giving Neco more game time....",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"Again we play our 2 best midfielders as centerbacks. Give Ozan Kabak a chance, he will prove himself. If we lose the game, so be it, but give those lads a chance. YNWA",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"A strong line-up as it needs to be. This game matters. The title race isn't over yet but the difference between winning and losing is huge points-wise. If Liverpool win this and City lose their game-in-hand, the margin is reduced to only 4 points. But if City win this game and their game-in-hand they will be 13 points clear of Liverpool. Almost difficult to catch then although there's still Leicester and Man Utd between them.

But anyway.... 'mon the Reds!!",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Why using midfielders when you have kabak and Phillips? Does it mean klopp don't trust them enough? Come on . Jones should have start from the bench. Anyways All the same let's go for win boys,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
Should of at least given kobak or Davies a start next to nat philips who hasn't played to bad to be fair. Hendo should be in midfield.,225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3
"This so called ‚ÄúFAN BASE‚Äù in this comment section is getting worse and worse every week. If you can‚Äôt support us when we are not at our best, then do one! üñïüèª this is Man City, the 2 new signings last week we‚Äôre playing at the bottom of the bundesliga and the championship. They need more than 2/3 training sessions to be ready. IN KLOPP WE TRUST",225,Liverpool,Man City,Home,-3

This favouritism will never give the Jota, Mane, Salah trio a chance which has a chance to be devastating and take us to the next level. The insistence on playing the out of form (and almost completely finished) Firminio has already disruptive to the moral of the attackers and affected their form, including Jota. Its really sad and pathetic a great manager like Klopp can have such a flow.

Seriously 2 weeks without a game and then more injuries someone really needs to have a look at what's going on in training too many players are getting injured,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
10 minutes of utter boredom. Absolutely not worth watching. Liverpool players can go on holidays right now. They‚Äôve earned it this season.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2

I don't like the defence we are having its more of gambling at a time when we are about to miss a champions league slot. At least kabak would help instead of R. Williams who many times forgets to defend n becomes a striker,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2

Ben Davies will not play at all. All of these injuries when he has not played at all and he was always available for Preston NE. Club just looking for a quick profit in the transfer market this summer.,346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2
"Great to see such an attacking line up at Anfield in a must win game... NOT!!!!

Three boring non assisting midfielders again, which will leave the three up front isolated, again!

"Davies injured or just not used, whats the point of buying him? Kabak injured too?? I think someone's not doing a proper job at LFC in training. Why all our players getting frequently injured?? Williams and Philips combination doesn't sound that reliable",346,Liverpool,Southampton,Home,2

"Wijnaldum is overrated. He has nothing to contribute in that midfield. Firmino should replace him. Wijnaldum can come in when we are winning. Milner, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Thiago and Fabinho play the same pattern. Among them, Fabinho is the best in that role. Wijnaldum is not a creative midfielder. He's a holding midfielder that prefers to play the ball back and sideways.

Our bench is coming stronger üí™‚ù§Ô∏è today is final Go Liverpool,376,Liverpool,Crystal Palace,Home,2
"Why we play always the same players? Klopp is a great manager but he doesn't give enough chances to our subs and that's why they can't develop in the first team! I think Klopp doesn't need any subs, as he is playing with the same fatigue and burnt out team!
I understand why top-class players don't want to come to our LFC team!",376,Liverpool,Crystal Palace,Home,2
When Liverpool lost at home to Everton in February I felt that Liverpool had no chance of finishing in the top 4. Since March there results have been good and now it's in there own hands so don't blow it. At least win by a couple of goals and try to get the match done by half time.,376,Liverpool,Crystal Palace,Home,2

Let's go there you all RED. Best of luck.,376,Liverpool,Crystal Palace,Home,2
Thought Jota was done for the season and Henderson‚Äôs inclusion is odd...,376,Liverpool,Crystal Palace,Home,2
Klopp should keep the CBs at the back and go for counter attacks in the 1st half. 2nd half it should be full attack and CB's can drift high up the pitch to attack as Liverpool players are top fit physically and Palace players will not be able to match them in physical fitness in the 2nd half.,376,Liverpool,Crystal Palace,Home,2
I ll never walk alone Jota to score on the final day,376,Liverpool,Crystal Palace,Home,2

"Rodrigo .... Rodrigo....this

Man city manager should learn a lesson that football is about goals and not how many passes or ball possession. The case at hand is man city vs Lei. How many shots on target?! Worst still the give away penalties.,26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
I am so disappointed that gracia is wrong much poor talent play let better him get out because of we hve hurt about him üòûüòûüòû.. Tell me what is the wrong ur team are many injured?? I havent understand what happen them man city üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
"I said it here, Pep has to sit up or go. The team is not up to standard. Pep is causing a lot of harm to the team. Ake and Garcia are useless. Buying Ake is like asking a tortoise üê¢ to run.",26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
"Would of had Torres or Delap in there to give us more pace up front instead of mahrez who‚Äôs to slow and got no pace
Also glad to hear Laporte‚Äôs on the bench can‚Äôt wait to see him play alongside Ruben dias when he comes",26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
Delap should've started ahead of Mahrez/Sterling,26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
"My problem with marhez is that he is too selfish,he should relax n be more creative rather than trying to score at all cost to impress pep..pep loves more creative players than just only a scorer which marhez is good at it so he shd concentrate more on it.aside that I think it's a good squad",26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
"Not Mendy again. How many times does he have to fail to be dropped from the team. Traore toyed with him in the last game. Where's cancelo, he's a better left back than Mendy",26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
If sterling is our striker for today then I won't expect much. Pep will soon have high blood pressure for fielding sterling as false nine. It has never worked but pep is adamant.,26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
In love with this squad but Mendy no.Although it is a must win.Boys do me good today.I trust you.,26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3

"Sometime i dont understand Pep, what is Garcia doing there? You are playing a big team like this without top 9 and you are using Garcia at the back. Just that i have to wish my team well if not. i think Pep will soon leave.",26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
"Stones played well last game, he should‚Äôve started again and not the boy who‚Äôs leaving or Pep is preparing him for Barca?",26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
The best player in Man City and Riyad Mahrez Only Pep does not admit that,26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
That midfield is excellent. Great to see Laporte back,26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3
The team to play Leicester is not up to standard. Vady will destroy the back 4.,26,Man City,Leicester,Home,-3

Good squad..I am behind the team ..,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
Great line up luiz cost us the game last time hope that doesn't back fire but holding is good enough,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"Must‚Äôve been very tempting to give Partey a start for this game, but for those whining that he‚Äôs on the bench, think about the situation. Arteta has had to gauge how well Partey has settled into his new environment and whether he‚Äôs settled enough for what will be a stiff examination. Arsenal will have a lot of time without the ball this evening, as Man City will almost certainly dominate possession. Throwing Partey straight into this game would be a big gamble, irrespective of his undoubted quality.",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"We are lacking creativity and if we don't win and possess this weak mancity team then ...arteta should check himself.. we nolonger want to be a mediocre team... We should be better... Bring back ozil ...I see hervatz ,salah and others doing nothing to defend",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"My prayers have been Answered. I didn't want the coach to start Partey in such a big game... Who knows it would have put him under pressure and affect his confidence.. Plus he didn't train with the team much enough.
Very good lineup",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"Gunners, Ozil is a spent force. He was great. His time is gone. This is a good starting XI.",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"I'm happy with the line up

I'm glad Arteta thinks Pepe is up for this game, which he will be. These 3, Auba, Pep and Willian is going to be a threat with their pace. Pepe will be good for the counter attack setting up Willian and Auba

Ceballos for the creativity and saka for the extra cover in midfield and for Tierney when he goes forward

I'm glad he chose holding over Luiz, he has too many mistakes in him and I feel him and holding understand each other better

Let's hope for an attacking game, this is a city team we can beat, let's not sit back like the Liverpool game üí™",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"I like this team.

Glad Tierney made it into the team. David Luiz form has improved in a back 3 but against a top team like city he just isn't disciplined enough.

Partey was never going to start after only 1 or 2 training sessions with the team.

I am surprisingly confident we can get something out of this #COYG but with Arsenal, it's the hope that kills.",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"Xhaka cant handle Liverpool and City, he is to slow, makes critical errors when pressured and is extremely ruthless with his tackles in dangerous areas of the field.",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
With Aguero and Sterling on the pitch. Gabriel and Luiz would have been the best combination. Gabriel doesn't know who Aguero is and Holding good but not too experienced.,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
Great team... Arteta has noticed Man City‚Äôs defensive weaknesses and wants to attack city with this line up . Too soon for Partey to start but I‚Äôm sure he will be given some minutes in this game #COYGüí™üèΩüí™üèΩ,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
Very good lineup. GOYG! Hope we get to see some Partey magic in the second half. :),46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"Great starting line up, didn't expect partey to start being new to the league an all but excited to see him come on in 2nd half üòâ",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
It's high time to Honour Ozil for what he has done for the club since 2014 n the achievements he brings to club we appreciate but we just have to Admitt as Gunners that its high time to release him in a good n respectable way for what he has done,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"The line up is great, for once let's learn to appreciate the work of this hardworking coach!",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"Arsenal is the ""stupidest"" team I have ever seem. Always buy player and put them on the bench. You will lose today. God bless you.",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"I have always said Arteta is unpredictable I'm sure he himself never knew he will select his team like this. Who could've believed that Luiz won't start, as for Pertay i understand he need to come from bench, but why is Lacazette not starting today? Any way, i think he knows better so let's back the team, Goodluck boys.",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
Looks like a real great line up by our standard. something good should come out of this hopefully,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
Still no Ozil on the picth and bench.. what happen to Ozil? Don't make best player in our team and most expensiv salary just look the boys game on tv,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
I honestly thk laca should leave the club and find somewhere that is better than arsenal.. He's the only striker scoring consistent for us and yet him can't start on a tough day like this,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"The sofa coaches shut up. Arteta knows what he's doing. Partey has just arrived calm and patience ... You ask a lot and, too quickly. The reconstruction is in progress and Arteta Edu have already done a great job. Confidence in the team and in the coach.",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"I don't support the first eleven, elneny supposed to be In, since the center back is not strong enough",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"#ARTETAOUT FOR DROPPING world champion and a player that played for Realmadrid.
Ozi is towering, talented and a tireless giant.
His electrifying and distinctive performances will continue to enlighten and inspire many generations.
Ozil is towering talented and skilful player.
We miss his rich contribution on and of the pitch. I told you this coach is useless because we signed parteybecause of this games and is still benching him.
Shame on Arteta",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"I'm actually happy with the line up today, and what a bench to have available too.
Ita been a long time since we have had a headache picking the best team. But thats a good headache to have. üëç",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"A game like this we should play Luiz and Lacazette ,, it's not that easy",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"I think I love this line up, Partey should come in the second half to defend our lead",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
Party name on bench! I totally agree with Arteta for naming Party on bench because he's still not familiar with Premier League and Arsenal style of play. So he need to study it well by watching his fellow teammates play before being given opportunity.,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
"It is all about team spirit, when the passion is right nothing is impossible. #COYG",46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
Nothing surprising. I knew he was going to do this nonsense. What more does Partey need to do to be in the squad. Nonsense,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1
This is a good line up. We should learn to support the team and stop complaining unnecessarily.,46,Man City,Arsenal,Away,1

Now that Alcantara is out and Keita also coming back from injury it makes perfect sense to pick both Bobby and Jota since Bobby is even naturally a midfielder

Klopp has manage this dilemma very well.

Good luck LFC",77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0

City have a more dangerous team.......

He can adjust the squad and try various formations like he did 4-2-3-1 last time and 4-2-2-2 this time and see how it works. He can risk with formation and style but never risk by benching his trusted ones.

Also because of previous results in the league we have to win now as. Southampton Leicester and Spurs are above,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
"A lot of pressure of Firmino expecting a ""classy"" game from him and if he is a ""false"" 9 it will be nice to see what he is really true 2.",77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
I was thinking all 4 could be in the same line up maybe with a 4-5-1 but not for this match. But Klopp must have some tricks up his sleeve that could work. Best lucks lads. Come on Reds! YNWA‚ù§Ô∏è,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
"Good to see Matip back.
Is Minamino injured? He is not on bench",77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
Not attacking enough with slow wijnaldum- needs keita or shaq who both drive forward unlike wijnaldum who just trots slowly around doing very little but always seems first on the team sheet,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
Great line up.we knw its a tough match but we the Champs.lets make it look simple.YNWA,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0

I feel it inside that this team is gonna destroy Pep and his lads come rain come shine,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
We will get overrun in midfield with playing both Jota & Firming.,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
Best form of defence is attack at the moment.,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
if our attacking game is on point this could be a massive 3points,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
"Good attacking line-up & creativity in the midfield.

Attack wins u games but defense wins u defense!",77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
A draw would be a good result. A victory then Liverpool could potentially motor on after the international break. A defeat would blow the race wide open with City creeping in. Still early days.,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
Please play me.i can replace Matip at the second half.i can defend and i can score.i will make sure we will win the game and i will score 1.we will win 2-1 if you (kloop)play me at the second half,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
I assume firmino will be dropping quite deep in a kind of no10 role or our midfield would be quite outnumbered,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
"Risky lineup against City, very worried, hope I'm wrong!!",77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
First time I‚Äôve seen Klopp start a classic 4-4-2 formation. Looks decent tho. Let‚Äôs go for the win,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
"Too many going forward that. Keita or Milner. Firmino sub. Defending is still not the best so will just keep the ball for midfield, even when it‚Äôs boring. If they can‚Äôt shoot they can‚Äôt score. Or we win 6-5 üò¨üòÇ",77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
Jota should have come off the bench. He's more lethal like that. The ox should just man up and stay fit. We need him for such games,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
"i hope this guy matip will avoid his injury problems over and over, he's the guy who is suppose to cover up for vvd when things are not well. Anyway keep strong ynwa you are always capable",77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
"Wow, nice lineups!! Certainly bobby & jota will exchange position leaving mane & salah unmarked",77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
"Really injuries are affecting our team jus look at the substitutes ,one defender",77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
Today Liverpool will walk alone because they are going to play against the best team in the world,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
Klopp just loves firmino. Why not play shaqiri instead of firmino??? Not fair on other players,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
It's good but we got to defend aswell unless he packing the midfield so they can defend and push on when they get a break av to wait and see,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
"Sorry for minamino really , he tried hard every game but it‚Äôs not really clicking for him and now not even in sub .",77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
I think it‚Äôs the strongest team minus injuries we have .... some solid players to bring off bench too,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0
Taking a big chance of being overrun in midfield. These are the games that we signed Thiago forüò§ but need to carry a threat going forward not like the last game soü§û,77,Man City,Liverpool,Away,0

"Why is all this marginalizing the Mahrez player, despite his brilliance in all Mahrez matches, he does not deserve to play in this team, after all that is going on, he deserves a basic positionüò°",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Hattrick scored against Burnley, the match followed by a reserve against Porto

He scored against Arsenal and won the man of the match today, a reserve against Newcastle

The level of the player has nothing to do with what happens The philosopher's policy of smashing the player continues üò™üíî",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Mahrez can‚Äôt start every game,algerian fans getting triggered",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
Neither mahrez nor foden.. i mean u search for consistency while benching players after every good match done by them..,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
I think Mahrez should of been given to Newcastle to play wirth 12 vs 11. We dont need him,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
I am not Algerian - but I do believe Mahrez is a good player who creates chances and should start games - also Foden should start regularly - surprised to see Aguero benched! However Pep was clear Santa Claus does not bring goals - its a shame that in 13 games only 19 goals have been scored compared to avg 40 goals in last 3 seasons.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Mahrez back on the bench where he belongs.
Thankfully its nearly Jan and we can bin him off.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
without mahrez? you're going to lose!,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
Mahrez raah thabalna you should leave this team you deserve better. You can't be in the same team with this weak coach man city a big team but with this coach became a weak one,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
City needs a win today to be number four on the table. A good boxing day gift.Let the boys play hard and smart.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2

"Although I am not an Algerian, I want to say that Mahrez deserves to play tonight. He was outstanding against Arsenal üëå Come on guys, he ain't that bad, isn't he? Sterling has not been playing well since last couple of weeks and could be dropped tonight. Dias has been playing consistently and there is a possibility for him being injured until rested properly. Eagerly waiting to see Sergio in the field ü§≤",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Mahrez is now only an average player, I'll be glad when he leaves. Hopefully he will take the Jingoistic fans, who know very little about football and never go to a game, with him. Bye Bye.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
If mahrez will go to real madrid ... Here is my face if he plays another match,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
At least this algeria is out ...we wasted money on this flop,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
I hope you will lose in all the matches until the departure of the artist Mehrez,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"I only have a question. I want to reach the coach, Guardiola, and the fans of the club. Why is Mahrez always the wrongdoer in the club?",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
Benching the last match's man of the match!!,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"If you‚Äôre a city fan you should be a mahrez fan regardless of your hate to the passionate Algerian fans, wether you like it or not, Mahrez still a great player and he deserves to start.
FYI : I don‚Äôt GAF what‚Äôs your opinion about Mahrez because everyone who has a clue knows that he is very talented and can change the a game in a blink of an eye",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Why no Aguero again? If he‚Äôs injured fine, but why then is he in the bench? I‚Äôm beginning to think Pep has an agenda against playing him? 99% of the fans want to see him start, so what‚Äôs the problem? Since he came to the club he‚Äôs treated Serge detrimentally in my opinion! Sick of it...üò°",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"WTF!!!! Why all this injustice. why mahrez is not playing????This
is more than injustice and far from logic, but rather under racism",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
The best player in the last game in the reserve ?????,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"What the hell is this? Bernardo in front and Aguero, Mahrez in sub?

Be mentally prepared for a catastrophic ending today",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2

You can just tell with the angry reactions that a certain player isn't in the starting lineupüòÇüíî,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
Why does he always pick gundogen and rodri at home it doesn't work,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2

"Good team but this false 9 never work,why not start Kun then rest him second half.Nway goodluck,have to win tonight.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
No other fans put angry faces when a specific player isn't started. Only the Algerians.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
I want to say something to Mahrez. You are wasting your time in Manchester City. You have to leave for a team and for a coach who knows your value as a player who has capabilities that Guardiola does not deserve. The problem has become personal that Guardiola is working on with Mahrez,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
I want to understand Guardiola why Riyad Mahrez is not playing,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Haha, so you can always see Sterling playing basic, I think there is an intimate relationship with Guardiola",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Seriously, what on earth does Foden have to do to get a game?!?",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Guardiola Do not talk to us about the tactical approach. Rather, tell us about your abhorrent racism towards the Algerian Riyad Mahrez. May God count us, and yes, the agent is in you, bald.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2

"i swear if Mahrez was a French national player, he'll be in the best football teams in the world,,,",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2

The reaction show there is no MahrezüòÇ,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Manchester City is a weak club that has not even won the Champions League, not once in its history. We follow international clubs such as Liverpool, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Milan and others ...... We are here only for our player, Riyad Mahrez üí™ üí™",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Riyad Mahrez is the best player in Africa, the best player in England previously, and the best player in the Arsenal match in the reserve Guardiola is the destroyer of African and Muslim talents.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
Another difficult 90mis for pep until he learns that early changes can win games,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
Mahrez and Aguero... Suppose to be in the starting line up...because Mahrez is more in form now than Bernardo ... And aguero is a better option in front of goal than Torres..,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
Nothing changes squad messed with as usual mahrez played well last time out benched foden benched laporte benched don't get why pep has to mess,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
Always gives me a good laugh when Mahrez isn‚Äôt in the starting 11,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
How can a player as the top scorer of the team and also get the best player in the previous match and effective and decisive passer and record fouls does not involve the basic how the mentality after the bye bye The tournament by the European Champions League,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Come on Newcastle United. Man City is very weak and very bad without Mahrez.
We are Newcastle United",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
I still think Foden deserve to play ahead Sterling looking at the current form,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"The blind support of the Mahrez fans has been insufferable for some time now. Look, he is a fine player. Excellent finisher. Allergic to defense. Doesn't make any of his teammates better. At this point I'd be begrudgingly ok if he left so his whining fan base would leave. Geez.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
I don't think this is the right lineup to win Newcastle ....i wont watch this match if he'll not change the line up,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2

Why Aguero not in the starting line-up? This decision is really very poor from Pep.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
Pep must use same formation for the teams which used to parkbus,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Manchester City is a very weak club with a failed history, and not once did it win the Champions League, so Mahrez must leave it immediately because it is much bigger than this club.
Pleasant loss today, Guardiola",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"So far pep has not understood this is the truth

What Mahrez lives will definitely be immortalized by history",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"One of the wonders of the world that appeared with the bald coach, whose hair fell from excessive philosophizing,
is not to include the best player in the last match, and this indicates his hidden hatred of Arab pride.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
Mahrez is inconsistent. Just find another club for Mahrez since you think he is underrated at City my friend.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2
"Aguero , fernandinho , mahrez , mendy in the bench and he think he will win ???? Wtf guardiola thinking !!!!",147,Man City,Newcastle,Home,2

If his grand plan is to sit back for 70 minutes and throw Wilson and Gayle on it‚Äôs going to be a long night. How the hell does Joelinton merit starting every bloody week?

Steve Bruce probably.",147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,2
I thought he would drop wilson as we will need him fit for the leicester game i dont think he will start against liverpool I think the team is set up to try and keep the score down. as goal difference will come into it at the end of the season. I will take a 2-0 defeat keep the score. I obvisouley love us to get a result tonight but I just cant see. city dropped 5 or their best players for the cup game with arsenal and they still scored 4 goals I predict tonight will be very painful to watch,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,2
"I think we all want to see us lose games to get Bruce out and this next 3 games should be the beginning of the end. Just sick of it all, un-watchable sh*te and his crack is horrendous pre and post match, everything he says is about it being difficult or hard, I wish 1 interviewer would say ""You should try watching it mate...""",147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,2

It's clear as day he is throwing the game. We have to rest Callum Wilson at some point so I suppose you may as well do it in a game the bookies have you 20-1 to win.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,2
Glad matty longstaff is finally getting another chance he's a great talent but the formation looks negative again 5 at back 4 defensive mids and joelintons just gunna play as an attacking mid we'll lose 2-0 and Ashley will see that as a good result,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,2
Why now are you playing matty longstaff Bruce? You had over year give him regular game time and throw him in against City of all teams. Just resign cabbage face your killing my passion for this amazing club.,147,Man City,Newcastle,Away,2

I don't know why some people think Mahrez must be stand in the starting formation of all games. City is a high class club with not only top players but very much top players on the pitch. I think it's right to say the coach makes the line up before every single game. And when he on the training ground see that some players are not really in firm or something else like this then their don't play from the beginning. As second I can say as a city fan I'm not really a fan of mahrez because I think he's a good one but are dribbling to much and to ineffective . I'm a fan from city and not only of Riyad Mahrez.

"I‚Äôd like to give a short lesson to some of the ‚Äúfans‚Äù.
There are twenty teams in the league. Position 20 is not so good. 1st position is the best. After reading some of the comments you may be fooled into thinking positions 2nd and 3rd are as bad as 20th. But you‚Äôd be wrong. 3rd comes after 2nd, and 2nd comes after 1st. As shocking as that sounds that actually means 2nd and 3rd are very good positions to be in. In fact better than the majority of other teams. I hope this was a valuable lesson for all.

Well that Liverpool result will mean however this game ends up I can go to work knowing tomorrow morning knowing that the scousers will all be quiet,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"My concerns are two.

1) Lindelof starting this game ahead of Bailly.
Why? City are Technical and a strong team , 4-2-3-1 formation might not work, United winning city in two or 3 occasions was 3-4-2-1 formation with the midfield highly choked. I would rather start with Baily - Lindelof - and Maguire as the last 3 , then I put shaw at the midfield as wingback.

2) I hope Martial didn't waste enough chances today anyway.
Good luck lads",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2

"Good luck to the team. And a good lineup too. I always worry when Rashford and Greenwood are in the same lineup because both of them just play for themselves, selfish and always wanting to shoot instead linking with Teammates who are in a better position.

Guys we need to be positive we do not have vandebeek and Pogba there Fred and Mctominay are needed in this game. To me we have some limitations in the midfield. We need team work and Lindelof needs to be very solid today. We can still beat mancity if everyone perfoms to his strengths. Martial should be a blast today and not Mr Clean boy,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
How does Lindelof have a back issue half the season and still start over a fit Bailly? Fred will give the ball away at least 7 times and foul in dangerous areas as always. Ole is absolutely clueless. Sick of it.,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
Again a fit Bailly on the bench and he does not start. Im not sure but jeez. And again the midfield will indeed lack creativity,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"Pretty good lineup.

I prob would of start Bailly but it don‚Äôt really matter...

Sucks that Edi Cavani is not on the roster. Def could of used him for this game but maybe there saving him for the Europa.

I think Martial will come through this game. He‚Äôs way overdue!!

Rashford don‚Äôt be selfish with the ball. Pass if need be. Don‚Äôt try to do everything on your own.

Let‚Äôs just hope the defense don‚Äôt give up stupid passes like last game because a team like City, they will capitalize on them.

Let‚Äôs get this win Manchester U. We need this!!!",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2

"Personally, bailly, matic and Greenwood in, Fred, martial and lindelof out.",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
Only a miracle can make us win this one we are already one man down in that Martial space,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
That's why we can't offer Cavani a contract extension. Always injured.,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
The lindelof and Maguire pairing will cost us today,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"This is one game we pretty much can do nothing to avoid the impending beating from Man City. We have no quality and depth in the squad, coupled with players' negative attitude. We can blame Ole for being an inept manager, but the truth is, there is nothing we can do here other than to wait and pray for luck to be our side",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
Why is Bailey not playing... üò°Why is Greenwood not playing ahead of martial.. We have lazy players on the field.. Let's just hope for something positive out this game,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"I still don‚Äôt like James he doesn‚Äôt defend or recover the ball well, he still doesn‚Äôt know how to cover a ball. Greenwood is much a better and better finisher.",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2

"Lindelof and martial, might as well just start the match with 9 players!
Hope Rashford gets his thumb out of his mouth and puts a shift in today also!!",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"Its a little bit strange that some fans wonder why Lindelof plays all the big teams instead of Bailly if you check the statistic. Bailly started totally 8 games this season mostly against smaller teams.

In those 8 games United let in 14 goals and had only one clean sheet.

Lindelof had played a LOT more games and 6 games against the big teams and United had 5 clean sheets and only one loss 1-0 to Arsenal.

So i think for every coach in the league it should be an easy choise when it comes to pick between those two.

Correkt me of i am wrong.

Forza Man Uüëä",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
The manager's stubnornness for not allowing to play Amad has already cost 3 games and the gap between city and utd has already become out of range. He should have given Amad a chance or twice to prepare him for this game. Also the results could have been different if he did so.,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"Hope today is a win for MU,am tired with draws...lets fire some shots..Martial should not relax today..",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2

#56yaMU not Martial!! . MacTominay is a boost with Fred. Pogba would leave us vulnerable as his defensive abilities are nil,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2

Ole sometimes I don‚Äôt understand his selection",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
Ole and his obsession with Lindelof and Martial are going to be his downfall! Why buy new players and continue to bench them,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
Fred James Martial Shaw McTominay Rashford all passengers today....under the cosh for most of this game even though we lead 1-0 outplayed totally our team is a shambles with no chance of silverware until we can get a manager who can show passion as Ole is boring and too nice.,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
what a disappointment to see Lindeloef and Maguire again in the 11 against the great Manchester City.,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"The odds of us winning this game are very low. Lets jus say that we have nothing left for us this season. The squad is too weak to provide enough for the team this season. We cant depend on a midfielder to provide goals for the club. Thats not how it works if u want to win every game. I think ole has to do strong transfer signings in the transfer window. Or else, i dont know our position in the next season",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
I rest my case. Shithouse ole. We'll get battered and won't score with martial playing. Worst united team ever,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"United face dropping down to 5th by next week if we don‚Äôt get a win. LC already 2nd and chelsea, everton right behind. Gotta win today! No excuses!",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
Already lost the game by starting Lindelof at the back,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"the reality is this, we have these players and we have to deal with them. The hope is that the star that protects OGS will not go out today. we have collected 32 goals and we are the eighth defense of the championship, let's hope for the best.",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"All the best to my team,,, it's not an easy game but we can make a difference",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"A lil bit more accuracy at their passing from Fernandes & Fred ...

This is a difficult game and we need to come out on top to prove we deserve that number 2 spot.

Man U all the way!!!üëè",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
I was guessing at a 5-0 loss would probably be about right but now I‚Äôve seen this line up we could probably add to that. Absolutely no chance of us scoring with Martial walking around and Rashford who has forgotten about football since focusing on charity work.,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
There is no way Edison deserves to get another contract... he can‚Äôt play 2 games in a row!,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
We will not win against City with 10 player on the pitch in whole game..,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
Despite we‚Äôre doing great in the midfield. But pogba is really missed.,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
Isn't it a crying shame we have so many expert football managers as fans yet when Sir A retired not one of you got the call ü§î,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
next season we have to kick on getting better each season. If Martial and Greenwood hadn‚Äôt had such a poor season in front of goal we would be pushing City all the way to the end,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
This isn‚Äôt a boxing match where u say in the red corner. We‚Äôre trying to get top 4 here not win a flaming title for god sake,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2

Guys is there an explanation for Cavani‚Äôs absence ? What am I missing ? As far as I know he is not injured. As for the rest of the team this is the usual team that OGS would pick from the available squad.,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2

"If Martial is in the squad, then I will use the 90 minutes more productively, maybe cut my toe nails, that's gonna be so much fun.",266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2

Going to get absolutely ruined martial? Id rather play my nan! Ole needs the boot,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
"All these negatrons on here go support someone else, probably only started supporting United when we were winning loads of trophies.

Good luck but i wonder what Martial can offer in a game like this or maybe he will give penalty,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
Am still solving how we are going to beat Manchester city,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2
Congratulation united fans the game was superb I miss pogba and cavani secondly Rashford is holding the ball for too long but you all gave us a smile..thank you,266,Man City,Man Utd,Away,-2

Good to see 3 of our best players in Fernandinho and Bernardo silva and foden starting shame the other 2 best players aguero and Torres only on the bench would have liked to have seen them both start as well but hope to see them in the second half for Gundogan and ethier de bruyne or mahrez,327,Man City,Southampton,Home,3

And we gotta really close them down and not give them time to build.

I love that Ole went for Fred and Tommy after the PSG performance.

BUT, i hate that the coaching staff is so ignorant and blind. How come we have players who perform outstanding (read Tuanzebe and Telles) where one is not even in the squad and the other in on the bench?

Tuanzebe got speed, tactical awareness and he can control the ball. Telles got outstanding crosses.

Where is the logic? No matter the outcome of todays match, our players who perform, need to be rewarded with a back to back place in the team.

How come, just because one player got the capitan armband, he is sure to play?

Ole, it is time to open your eyes. It is time to give our right players, the trust they deserve...

Stop using players, who do not perform and therefor do not deserve to be in the first elleven.

"Sorry a long post.. But I love to talk when we are moving in the right direction.. I agree with your thoughts. Pundits and all the fake supporters wouldn‚Äôt have given us a chance seeing the line up. Pogba and Greenwood on the bench, according to all the statisticians we were doomed to defeat. I know Ole‚Äôs still learning, so was SAF when he started. We shouldn‚Äôt be going for a quick fix but for a long standing dominance on the premier league. If I see short term it‚Äôs going to be a struggle as our team is not the finished article yet. Haaland as our no. 9 and if Pogba doesn‚Äôt want to stay with us then with his sale get 1 play maker and 1 DM along with a good central defender. I have a feeling we don‚Äôt need to go for Sancho with the singing of Pellistri and Diallo. Just my personal thought. We have bought good since Ole on the wheel. Hope he buys smart and gets us back to winning ways. GGMU üèÜ",136,Man Utd,Leeds,Home,4

A very good tactical switch reminding Leeds that when they decide to throw in forward press they should remember James and Rashford are on the pitch. Keep Leeds on the defensive. Just hope this works out.,136,Man Utd,Leeds,Home,4
I thought Ole wanted to win. If he wants to rotate his team he has better players to put in than James and Fred. Truly time for Ole to do the right thing and step down. He is making us fans very unhappy,136,Man Utd,Leeds,Home,4

"Our performances are slightly improved, since the introduction of a new coach to assist bruce, however we are still miles behind, we will be lucky if we survive, we will lose our quality players at the end of the season and be back to square one.",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
We need two wingers and Carroll on the pitch to bully their back line ! Joelinton is a waste of an employee number !,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
The two main men are in miggy and ASM that's a good start for us. Man United won't be pleased Leicester are above them so will be giving it some welly tonight. HWTL,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Bruce brings it on himself when he‚Äôs got Fraser on the bench and plays joelinton,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Looks like 4 4 2. Leaving us wide open. When is Bruce gona see that sometimes you have to play 5 4 1 especially at Old Trafford. For me Dubravka best keeper. I can't see anything other than 3 0 üòî,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
And so the circus begins again with the Chief Clown in charge ... another step towards inevitable relegation.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Lewis is a huge liability. He has zero marking skills, he makes poor descisions. I dont understand why Richie isnt taking that LB instead.

Anyways HOWAY THE LADS!",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Be surprised if unites don't score 5... I know we haven't got great players but setting up like this is an invitation to get mauled... Whys joelinton starting ahead of gayle and Shelvey waste of time Lewis and krafth will be made to look like there not there,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"I can live with this. Questions are how deep will they sit and for how long, and also what type of shift is Joelinton willing to put in. Wilson does a lot, on and off the ball, while defending and attacking. Can Joelinton provide the same or something close. Cheering them on from Fort Worth, Texas! #ToonArmyUSA",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Whinged for weeks he couldn‚Äôt play maxi and Fraser together and again benches Fraser, When he has the opportunity, and even more so that we don‚Äôt have Wilson, our team is screaming out for us to run at their back 4 with Miggy ASM and Fraser",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I dread every game nowerdays. If we get any type of result it will be through blind luck as far as tactics are concerned,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
5 at the back and no striker. Also Ritchie who can actually cross a ball on the bench again. No chance tonight. With Fulham winning last night we should be very worried. #bruceout,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Very negative line up in a game that we are going to be up against for the whole game man united will be laughing and Fulham will be thinking our goal difference will take a battering,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"I love seeing you lot hammering Steve Bruce, you‚Äôve got the worst owner in the history of any football club......even guardiola and Klopp couldn‚Äôt get anything out of this club with him as the owner",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Time for shelvey to move on, he‚Äôs done nothing this season. We need to get some fresh leg in midfield.
Hope I‚Äôm wrong but think it will be 4-0 to Man U.",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Seriously WTF does cabbage heed see in jokelinton he's the laziest most useless player we have ever signed an insult to the great number 9s we have had I could cry. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Why no Frazer? He was the only player to inject any quality deliveries into the box when he came on last match.
Shelvey needs to up his game, far too casual and lazy. And as for Joelinton, well l am at a loss as to what Bruce thinks he gives the team.
Lewis will get run ragged again, this match, is lost before a ball is kicked.
Personally, l might give the nod to Dubravka today, better distribution, which is needed considering how many times the ball goes back to the goalie, and commands the back line better too.",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"About right from Bruce, play joelinton on his own up top when he's not a striker let alone a forward",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Love Darlow but this isn‚Äôt a game he should be involved in with the amount of crosses that‚Äôll be coming his way üôàüôà,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I hope Kraft and Lewis shock me and have a game....to really shock me let‚Äôs see Joelinton rated at more than 6/10,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
We could start with 14 players and still lose and not have more than 35% possession,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Disappointed to have joelinton up front he‚Äôs not a striker I‚Äôd of tried miggy up there at pit Richie LW but hopefully we will have a crack at them ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2

"No strikers and once again leave the man who can put threatening crosses into the box off the pitch. Fraser, you should have gone elsewhere lad you‚Äôre being wasted here!!!",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Carroll on the bench and Joelinton on the pitch. I hope Bruce is sacked after this. It‚Äôs the end for us if he isn‚Äôt,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Omg still no dubravka or dummet
9 players again I see and shelvey the so called work horse",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I‚Äôm struggling to see why Matt Richie isn‚Äôt getting a game at the minute. He has a lot of drive and push.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Cant believe he's starting Joelinton up front been coming off the bench and doing nothing plus he won't track bk,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Carroll holds the ball up better than joelinton which i guess is what we will be doing defending all game then whacking it up field in hope joelinton can hold it up ( which he wont). We wont even string a pass togeather tonight,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"How on earth is Joelinton starting, why not play Gayle or Carroll, Dubravka should be in for me aswell, I fear the worst yet again, #bruceout",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Got to be the worst back 4 in the league and for weeks Shelvey has been walking around waiting for the final whistle,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
No Dubravka. Disappointing ‚òπÔ∏è,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I would have Dubravka instead of Joelinton,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Joelinton FFS, how can this guy get a start in the team. He‚Äôs offered nothing",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
As well as Darlow has done this season I would like to see Dubravka starting again,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Joelinton useless. The player attacking Kraft will be involved in at least 2 goals.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Why not fraser instead of joelinton...he has offered nothing all season.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Both Carroll & Gayle deserve the start before that plank up front!,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"It's such a shame Bruce has never had the chance to play maxi and Fraser together.......
Oh wait",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Seriously what has Matt Richie done? Why isn't he playing?,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
For all the use joelinton will be we should of just splayed Almiron as striker with Fraser and st max on sides be more dangerous than joelinton,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I definitely wouldn't have joelinton I don't know what Bruce has against Gayle.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Well another miss match another loss and another step closer to relegation!!!! Can't wait for kickoff,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Krafth / lascelles very dodgy at the back. Always a worry when I see krafth in, why Murphy isn‚Äôt playing is beyond me.
We can only hope for something tonight but can‚Äôt see much tbh.
HTL ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Carroll should start. He‚Äôs a nuisance just what we need to do bully Man Utd. But no jolenton omg clueless Bruce is. We need 3 points and he leaves Carroll on bench what will jolenton do. Will he make himself a nuisance in the box !!! Nope .,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Big joe up front..I can already hear the interview....we
ll they are a big big team.we will get back on the training ground and go again",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Darlow came in and performed well - even excellently at times - but Dubravka needs to be back in that starting XI.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Disgrace they drop Gayle after the team couldn‚Äôt give him any type of service in the last game. Steve Bruce must want us all to turn in mackems üòÇüòÇ,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Why is he not playing Gayle , as long as he doesn‚Äôt set them up in the defensive set up Gayle given the chance will score. So angry atm",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Dubravka should be back now, I know darlow hasn't let us down but Dubs is no1",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I would play Carroll up from with maximin in a free role behind him and have Frazer and almiron on the wings. Sorted!,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
How on earth is joe playing this game offers nothing,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I wish Bruce would just give it up he's had a crack he can't do it it's time for him to go if he cares about the club this will b his last game in charge,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Why has he played Darlow again tonight Dosen't dubravka deserve a game in goal‚ö´‚ö™,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"4-3-2-1 is our best formation, but not away at Old Trafford against an in form team, and without a recognised centre forward. Bruce found 1 plan A a few games ago, and has proven yet again that there is no plan B. Get him out now or we will get relegated.",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Don't want to sound negative but if I want to watch men going down a slippery slope I'll turn over and watch Ski Sunday instead....,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Better performance than usual but both full backs nutmegged resulting in goals. Speaks volumes.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"This will not be good for our goal difference,,got

"How it's Justifiable to start Jolelinton over Gayle and Carroll, will forever prove a mystery and Pinpoint everything that is Wrong with our Club",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Oh God the Three Stooges are playing Emil Krafth who cant tackle and turns his back when a player shoots ,Jamal Lewis the most light weight defender ive ever seen who runs around like a chicken with no head and doesnt know wot hes supposed to do in his position and lastly Joe Linton who must hold the record for worst ever center forward for the Toon as he s pants .So i think Fulham must be loving us as here we go again and waiting for the excuses from sad sack after the game",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Soooo..... Anyone else gonna turn their phone off and just deal with the abuse from their Man U pals in the morning!,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Lascelles needs to be dropped too. Dummy is far better. Fernandez, Clarke & eventually Lejunne are our best centre defenders, Dummy back on the left would be good.",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
So the clown identified Joelinton shouldn‚Äôt be update alone a few weeks ago and goes back to playing him up front üò©,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I think joelinton is one of the worst players we‚Äôve ever had. Feel like throwing the tv out the window!,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Good confidence building for Gayle there by Bruce. Dropping him for Joel when tbh half the team if not more should be dropped after last performance. Cannot see us getting anything today!,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Shelvey has to go, gayle is only viable forward option",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Was going to watch the game but after seeing the team sheet I don't think I'll bother, it'll be a cricket score",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Playing well at the minute don't mind getting beat when we have ago come on the Toon,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"We're 4th bottom for a reason. Players are nowhere near good enough, cheers Ashley",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Why play Joelinton? Gayle or Carroll should be getting a chance. Bruce needs to go x,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Strongest side we could have put out with the injuries,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
See Steve Bruce has put Joelinton in the starting eleven; I did hope Joelinton would have gone for another haircut during this last week!,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Ffs - we are starting with 10 men having Joelinton on the pitch.What's wrong with starting with Fraser.Hopefull
y,this is Bruces's last game.",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
That is garbage from Bruce joelinton lascelles and kraaft should not even be on the bench what is wrong with Richie Fraser Carroll it‚Äôs a joke this club,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Bring on the other goalie he is better than darlow,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I look forward to the comments on here more than the game itself..,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Would it take joelinton to littrelly murder an opposing player to be dropped out of the squad? Someone needs to accept they made a horrible mistake with him and move on.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
He is playing for a draw from the start. 1 point puts us 4 clear of Fulham,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"How many chances is he going to give Joelinton, play someone with pace instead, at least they can offer something, Gayle or Fraser. 3 goals in 56 games.",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Is there any point watching? Most of the bench are better than the out field players,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
To be fair he is playing ok but there are for or five who need to do more. Top of that list is ASM,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Call me cynical but the transfer of the Brazilian kid needs investigation. Money laundering comes into question.????,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Why is he up front again, we have other players better than him",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"hate to say it but, dead rubber. just get through it with no new injury concerns and a low score deficit and i'll take that, our key battles to avoid the drop are yet to come.",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Surely Maxi up front with Fraser supporting makes more sense??? Murphy had to play ahead of Krafth, he offers so much more!!",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Win and save the earth from noise pollution for one more week magpies,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Carroll who is our best chance of owt in the air with 2 rapids like miggy and st max and we have a bit of sumet. I‚Äôm no manager but I know Newcastle. Am I wrong? Don‚Äôt shoot me down it‚Äôs just my opinion.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Could be a cricket score looking at that line up,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Nice to give Gayle a run of games will really convince him to sign that contract ..
And with jamalibilaty at centre half and 2 of premier league's laziest Shelly and asm think I'll stick a film on instead",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
The players need to smile when walking out on to the field. HWTL,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
My prediction is 3-0! Plus Bruce spouting about positives in Press Conference afterwards ! Darlow MOTM for keeping their doel saldo down to the 3 goals ! Yawn ü•±!,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Lewis shouldn‚Äôt be starting if Dummett is fit. We all know joelinton should‚Äôbt be anywhere near the 1st team.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I just dunoh if I wanna waste my time watching the first half or just last remaining 45 mins but all i guarantee you this Bruce will say I seen some positives from the second half üòñ,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Darlow again??? Best player of last two season still sit on the bench... Omg championship is waiting #bruceout,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"I would start Murphy at right back instead of krafth, krafth is the weakest link in defense",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Imagine being Manure's front line with this. Fernandes won't even have to get out of 2nd gear and Shelvey is going to be lost.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Weakest full backs in the league. Man Utd wingers will be licking their lips after seeing the line up. Fed up with the Lewis is still young nonsense. He is not good enough whatsoever. One of the worst full backs we‚Äôve ever had.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
This might work if Joelinton goes in goal and Darlow has a go up front üëçüèª,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Is he having a fuking laugh jokelinton might as well give up kid couldn‚Äôt score in a brothel #bruceout,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
High pressing and numbers forward. Penny finally dropped for Bruce over last few weeks.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Howay the lads. Joe Linton to get the winner or assist to Miggy or ASM. However I think Willocks will score from a long range shot at the edge of the box.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Should have fraser and maxi either side of miggy would be hard for any team to compete with that.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Joelinton has a bad back? Is that why the rest of the team have to carry him? Jesus he is embarrassing,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
I wouldn't start darlow. Is it gonna take him to get an injury for him to be dropped?!?!,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
"Should have given Gayle a run in the side, with Jokelinton we may as be playing with 10 men. 5-0 to Man Utd. Sack Bruce after this. Fulham will catch us now and we will be relegated. Once we are caught up in the bottom 3 players will express their desire to leave and the knock on effect on player mentality will be unrecoverable.",247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Get Ritchie on. Lewis is to scared to have a run with the ball. Every ball is backwards.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
Why is Gale on the bench again. Has 1 bad game and he is benched. Joelinton hasn‚Äôt had 1 good game since signing and still gets a game.,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2
HTF is Joelinton in ahead of Carroll or Gayle!? Clueless. Unless he‚Äôs plays Alan as a no.9. No hope,247,Man Utd,Newcastle,Away,2

Saw how well that worked out for Martial on Thursday.

Ole doesn't trust his subs, so even when his favoured lot are half fit he will pick them over giving someone else a chance.",277,Man Utd,West Ham,Home,1
"Rashford shouldn't be starting unless he's fully fit. Which he isn't. If his injuries get worse, then it's on Ole. A fully fit D.James is better than a half fit rashford for the team And I dont rate James that much. As can put 100% in and not fear getting injured more. And if you think otherwise then why isn't Pogba, Donny, Cavini or Martial not playing when they injured too? I just don't want Rashford to be ruined by over playing and playing him through injuries.

Playing magalof is a mistake, against Antonio, as he's quick and fast. Just hope it isn't a losing mistake. Bailly should play, as we going have play deep because magalof can't deal with quick players. They can't even deal with Girouds pace ffs . Mcfred might work but no creativity, in this game.

If Woodward thinks this is progress then he should leave tonight along with Ole. We have made no progress in over 2 years. Fred Shaw James McTominay Rashford constantly give the ball away and that‚Äôs why we will win no trophies with them in the team as they are not good enough neither is Lindelof and Greenwood now looks uninterested. Ole shows no passion while watching his tv it‚Äôs embarrassing really for the biggest football club in the world.

Looking forward to another game of lacklustre football! Poor tactical decisions by ole and a lot of sideways passing. Pretty much same as every game. At least pogba starts so we will get something else thrown in to the equation like him throwing himself to the floor after losing the ball after keeping it too long! Cant wait to see freds expert passing game in action i love how it looks as though he only controls 50% of the the movement in those legs of his,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1

"Come on reds, results have gone our way so far this weekend dont blow it",297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
This confirms De Gea is leaving. Ole broke the agreement regarding the goalkeeping playing time. De Gea was agreed to play all league games (when available) and Henderson in the cup competitions.,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
That's a quality line up but i do worry with Fred in midfield. Hopefully buy a world class DM in the summer..,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
We needed scott to sit in from of the defends..matic and pogba wont help the defends,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
But why does our coach like fred.This guy can't defend and he can't complete passes.,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
"Is Henderson really a better goalkeeper than De Gea though?The obvious answer is no! De Gea hasn't had the best season and made mistakes, and while he was away,Henderson made it his place.But is he the long term answer? I'd much rather have a keeper like Kasper Schmeichel. I think we've seen the last of De Gea who will probably go back to Spain to be with his family now.",297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1

"I really don‚Äôt understand this lineup, we are never consistent with our lineup, we can‚Äôt keep on playing Pog as a holding, we need to release him, Scott is better than Fred , Fred is not disciplined, he‚Äôs very careless with the ball",297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
"I‚Äôve been a Utd fan for 40plus years and this team is so depressing. They have no plan, no organisation, and no idea. But worst of all no work ethic, you watch city and they work their socks off. This lot just stroll around waiting for their pay packet to land on the door step. SO POOR IT HURTS.",297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
"Lindeloff, Maguire and Fred starting. May aswell throw the towel in now. Just seen Welbecks goal.........wh

"Nice line up..
Maybe this is the stronger line up we have now..
Ok 3 points easy..",297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
Not bad line up even though I think scot would have started instead of fred cos fred and pogba enjoy playing on right side and leave left side .yet scot is good on left side of de pitch so it become balanced when pogba play with scot .,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
Hopeful the xl is strong enough i have no doubt,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1

"De Gea is MOTM in his last game. He goes away for a valid reason, and comes back to sit on the bench? It‚Äôs not like Hendo has played against world class opposition and done well.

That‚Äôs a near perfect line up from OGS except Fred who seems to be a weak link. Also I have some doubt about our number 2 ( Lindelof) because he has been struggling with pace. I hope he is on his good day today. Excellent decision to pick Henderson over DeGea and Cavani over Martial. Let‚Äôs go Man Utd and beat Brighton today to cement our 2nd place.,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
So Degea is no longer in 1st team now!? He is in a level of a bench player now!? I hope he will be leaving at the end of the season to look for a Green pasture. I'd not like to see him get wasted on benches he deserves first 11 somewhere else,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
I as a Chelsea fan hate you. May you loose this game with a goal difference of -6. May you hit the posts forever. I was born to hate you.,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
The way Ole and the club treat De Gea is bloody disgraceful !! Henderson is seriously overrated !,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
I don't know why the English press is pushing this Henderson guy to be number one? The original English hype. He's not good enough.,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1

"On behalf of the free mode users, I'd kindly wish to ask anyone to interpret the posted image and tell us the line up. Thanks",297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
De Gea‚Äôs getting moved on next year. Totally fine shipping him out to raise some funds for other needs. Henderson is a more than capable replacement considering De Gea‚Äôs form the last 2 years.,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1
The fact that De Gea is not in the starting lineup shows that Ole is listening to us... Good line up,297,Man Utd,Brighton,Home,1

Why risk Rashford when we haven't got a game for a week and he's struggling with an ankle injury and needs a rest.,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Matic played really well last game and performs better when we play such teams. I would swap him for Fred without hesitation.,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2

Dont understand why Cavani is sub? He must be fit if hes sub! Hes in good form so why bench him? We have a weeks rest after today too!!,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2

"This is ridiculous!!! Why is Edi Cavani on the bench?!?! Are you kidding me! He‚Äôs in great form and it‚Äôs just getting back to his scoring ways and you bench him.

Greenwood is not the number 9 we need..

OLE what are you thinking!?!

Let‚Äôs get this win reds!!",317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
"Rashford just recovered yes but Cavani should start.
Understanding ole needs a brain surgery",317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
We are playing Burnley at home. Why 2 defensive midfielders? Ole is always looking at being ultra safe. Only need McTominay and could have played VDB. Fred‚Äôs goal last week means we have to put up with him for some time yet unfortunately,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Should have rested rashford it's Burnley man!,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Good line up but I would have prefer Van de beek and Cavani to start,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
"Dont understand why he plays both Scottie and Fred... only need Scottie there. Fred is useless on the ball, gives it away, scored 2 goals in 2 seasons and his shooting is atrocious. A 58 million quid flop.

Scottie can handle the DM and the tough work... bring in Donny and let him play the deep lying Mid role....",317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
So Bruno desperately needs a rest and has done for weeks. I would have left him completely out of the 18 for this game and the last game to allow him to try and get back into some form. Start pog or VDB in the Bruno role in his absence. He‚Äôs completely burnt out,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2

These are the games Cavan should be featured. Burnley are difficult to break down and you need one with intelligent movement in the box. Hope we get 3 poits.,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2

He is so full of mistakes! He might have some promise but I don‚Äôt think he will ever be worthy of a number 1 slot for Man U!",317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
The lineup is OK but the only erra is leaving Cavani out.,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Home to burnley... why do we need 2 holding midfielders? Play mctominay and give vdb a proper run out. Cavani scoring and playing well play him from the start get the job done then make some changes,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
"All the best team, I wish Cavani could start with Rashford to the left and Greenwood to the right and Pogba with McTonay. Fred could be on the bench. Anyway we're still the stronger side. All the best",317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Good line up but would prefer Cavani to be in the 1st eleven tonight,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
We're playing Burnley at home (a fixture we've struggled to win in recent years due to Burnley being difficult to break down). So why on Earth are we playing 2 holding midfielders!? Beggars belief!,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Nd u said Henderson is what better than DeGea... There is more to come like Rashford is a waste of sub today,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
"This match is not going to be easy at all.
It is not all about ole nor the players but the record we have with Blackburn at home.
Since 2009 we started playing them, we have met six times at home and won only once at home.
One out of six.
And we have never won them home and away the same season.
Even sir didn't do it.
We just need to follow this game with caution and step by step. We should also ready to accept any way the results goes though I pray we break that yoke today.
Good luck to us.",317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2

I really like the new role Pogba is playing seeing them together with Bruno Fernandez it's awesome in midfield.,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Rashford should have come in second half and cavani first,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Why James always in the bench,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2

Any particular reason Cavani is on the bench because I cannot understand which coach will put his very in-form player on the bench when he‚Äôs fit and not suspended,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Ole is another useless coach. Why bench Cavani when he is on form,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
"Why dropping Cavani when he's on form? Burnley are tall and strong, they will bully Greenwood, someone like Edison would be better",317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Pogba is fantastic on the left but it means we have to sacrifice Rashford to play on the right. It‚Äôs like playing with 10 men when he plays on the right. He is just so ineffective.,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2
Should have rest Bruno and start VDB. We need Cavani and Bruno fully fit for next match.,317,Man Utd,Burnley,Home,2

It's in our hands to go for the win and keep whatever lead we have to finish games off and bring on fresh legs with 10-15mins to go.

We all know if we're winning or losing Sean won't bring anyone on until 89-91st min!!!

What's the point in having a youth team at this club if you don't give them the time to shine and make a name for their themselves like McNeil? 1-2mins is not enough time?

As much as I love what Sean has done for this club....he can't keep blaming the board for not spending, when he has a great set up behind the scenes.

if he can't bring in the youth to prove their worth? I don't blame them if they want to leave in the future and some of the first team go as well.

Come on Sean...we trust you and always will.....just go for it and bloody see our youngest and staff reap the rewards of all that hard work?

Seriously stop presenting the line up in order of shirt numbers!!! So wrong! The actual team sheet however is very pleasing. What an interesting game this will be!,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1

"Quality line up ... well played ole

Put a shite team out ... Leicester win another step to condemn scousers to Thursday night ü§£ü§£",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
What exactly is going on at Old Trafford??? Which kind of a starting line up is this.. we better get serious or unless we've given up on the title already.,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
Many players have the opportunity today to show us what they can do .Ole gives a great importance to the match of the next Thursday against Liverpool,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"I thought maybe Cavani would get a start since he only played 30 against Villa. Otherwise, this is the EXACT lineup I expected. Pure house money game. Win, MU keep pressure on City and a have a stronghold on 2nd. Lose, and they screw Liverpool. So I'm good either way. Excited to see that young frontline, though.",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
It's great to give the other players an opportunity to play. Rest the first squad as much as possible before Europa final.,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
This is great. At least we have a great bunch of good players that we can bring in to rest some players. Let's have faith in our players and see if they can still deliver despite the fact that some of them did not play first team football for a while now. Let's go United....,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"Go on guys.
For those worried about Ole‚Äôs decision, I think those players need some rest. I‚Äôm not expecting them to be on the pith at 48hrs intervals.
I believe these set can do it and if they don‚Äôt, we are still United",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"We are already confirmed top4 and we are already in the europa final so why waste time to use all the main player.
We had a lot of games this week..
So its better to put the best lineup against liverpool.
Let all the main player rest while can give other player more play time..",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"We shall be sending liverpool direct to Europa. Arsenal should just form a boys band, football ain't their thing",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
The line up is on purpose. So that liverpool don't make the top 4! But we're so good even our under 18s are capable of winning the match!ü§£üòÇ,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"That's nice from our gaffer. Let's give minutes on those fringe players. They deserve minutes to prove their potential since we are facing a congested fixtures. Remember, on Thursday we are facing our foe in the name of Liverpool. Let the likes of Edi Cavani, Rashy, Paulo, Bissaka, Bruno et al rest for the big Thursday. Genius Mata, Adama, VDB et al can terrorize Leicester. Go on boys and collect three points.",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
I'm very interested to see how we play today. Leicester only had one extra day off and got battered by newcastle so fatigue is showing.,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"I guess this is what they call ""trial and error"" approach",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"As much as several of these players need game time,you don't just throw all of them in a game together without the core of the team. This is putting undue pressure on them. The manager has had countless opportunities to try to integrate the likes of Donny,Amad,Bail
y,etc into the team but has let them pass.",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"So many people missing the point.... Utd have no choice but to rest all 11 players... they only played 48 hours ago ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.... player well-being is the most important thing, not pleasing other teams who have failed to win their own games.... Utd will play a strong team v Liverpool as those players have had the correct rest days....",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"This is what any sane Manager would do, the schedule isn't great. Thankyou Ole today I am on your side..",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
It will take a miracle for our team to win this game With this lineup üò≥üò≥üòêüòë,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"I knew this would happen and its good for the young lads to showcase their talent, if we win its bonus",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
Wishing the boys all the best but a lose is possible considering the form of Leicester I respect the coaches decision its a tight schedule we need to rest some,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"Excited and buzzed up to see these lads take on the big game. Whatever the result, I'm happy for them.",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
This is what we needed resting players because on Thursday we have a game against Liverpool let the senior team also play,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
Loving the rotation. Not expecting a great result but fingers crossed.,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"oooh no, this one will cost us but am sure its meant to give game time to players like Tuanzebe, Mata, Elanga, Baily who hav warmed the bench all season and gettin paid 4 nothing. time to utilise these talents",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
Looks like he is only interested in the Liverpool game! Good to see other players getting a chance to showcase their talents.,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
Smart by Ole lets not lose to Liverpool and City win the league lets try our best to keep Liverpool out of the CL and give Leicester the advantage and lets see how many of these players deserve to be there next season another shocking performance MATIC great defending on the winning goal,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
This could be a stroke of genius if it works out and we get 3 points tonight. Backing Ole all the way,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"Great to see Anthony Elanga in the lineup hope the lad has a good game, its the 14th player from the Utd Academy to be handed their debut by Ole, well done to our manager for giving our young players a chance and keeping the utd tradition very much alive.",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
FA made it impossible for West Ham to make UCL by aligning United fixtures in such a way that United have to throw at least one match this week against one of West Hams rivals for the spot.,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
I think it's a good line up very capable of winning the game easily good to see the youngsters being given a chance let's go lads you can do it,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"Sensible choice. Let‚Äôs face it the title is cities anyway, so let‚Äôs see what the fringe players can do, and who we need to keep at the end of the season. Keep the faith and GGMU...‚ù§Ô∏è",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"All the best to Amad, and Elanga! This might be a rotated United squad, but boasts quality. Thrilled to see what some of the young guns will show us tonight",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1

"We have Liverpool on Thursday, Liverpool game involves pride so let's the big players rest.
Losing to Liverpool hurts more...
I guess people complaining haven't been following the team.",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
Good team considering we have a number of games coming up. Gives the other guys time to rest,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
An expected lineup considering the fixtures and the fact United have confirmed a top four finish. Good luck to the young lads. Who knows we might discover another Greenwood today,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
GGMU!!! I am happy with the young lads getting a chance to do us proud. It also demonstrates the depth of the team. Excited to see Bailly in the line up.,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"The rotation is welcomed, we have so many games in just a handful of days to play",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"Great to see Amad and Elanga getting a go at it... If only Pelestri hadn't gone on loan, he too would have had his chance... Win; draw or lose today, I am 100% in support of this team!",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
Better city win the Epl easy than liverpool qualify for Ucl,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
WTF is this line up? Leicester arnt a push over whats ole going to say I'm saving my best team for liverpool no chance of winning this game,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
This chap is unbelievable ! how on earth can he act like a team that hv already won the league with such little points separating the team with positions 3 to 8,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1

"Understandable,
we cannot overwork players lest we call for more injuries... We have a final to win... Man City had won this 2 or 3 games ago so no need to stress... If anything I don't want to be beaten by LFC... So Ole is right here...",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1

What if we lost against Leicester and still loose against Liverpool?

Ole wats up now?",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
You don't rest 9 of your best players. These are professionals they can play every other day that's how champions do. Leicester is an easy game compared to liverpool so what is the coach's priority to lose both or atleast win one iam just thinking and I hope this is a fake lineup to confuse the opponents,354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
Maybe you'll miss info. This team is secret team which is Ole try to keep secret for a long time. This team will let competitor score first and against and MU'll win when ending match. Believe me! It's true :),354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1
"i wised all should have their chance in the pitch, but this looks too adventurous",354,Man Utd,Leicester,Home,-1

I know you are a local and so no matter what difficulties the team faces, you are still the one with the most emotions and thoughts. But you know, not all of you are fans of ManUntied, we are foreigners but we also love ManUntied. Because of our geographical location, we have a time zone difference, to be able to watch a game of our favorite team we always have to stay up until 2 am, after the game we still have to go to school, go to work again. So please, no matter what happens, please let the game go, for the team, for yourselves and for us, the foreigners who love ManU.

"A few days back, i questioned the importance of Fred on the team, and i was suggesting that should united want to improve next season, we would need a better player. Many criticised me. Today, Fred is showing again how much a liability he is when we play against similar or superior quality teams. I never questioned his dedication. He runs, be tracks, he makes lots of efforts, yet this is overshadowed by his poor passing and decision making.

Overall this is an underperforming
team tonight. Captain Harry is missed at the back, and Bailly...no comments.",336,Man Utd,Liverpool,Home,-2
10 changes to Tuesday's lineup. Wow. It would be a crime if our first team hands Liverpool a lifeline. Of the 4 matches they have left only our matches is a challenge. Liverpool needs to be playing on Thursday evenings next term.,336,Man Utd,Liverpool,Home,-2

Bench is also key there for next season.... very poor! Where is a quality midfielder who‚Äôs going to link play & scare defenders with their passing? Where is the attacker who‚Äôs going to get goals (aside from Greenwood who would start for me most games)? Need to buy some quality to challenge next season!,336,Man Utd,Liverpool,Home,-2

Shelvey n Haydon in centre...... cant see too much exciting football coming from that. Ones defensive minded and other is lazy come on Bruce sort this out,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Bunch of moaners on here ! I think joelinton has done ok last few games. All the people bewildered Almiron is on the bench, the fella struggles with the final pass or shot, yes he is a good team player granted but we don‚Äôt need to play him every game.. maybe Bruce is thinking this will be a physical game so has gone for the bigger player ? What do I know... Joseph Tinsley-Black awaits witty response....",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Think Murphy should have started and big joe should start with Wilson they need to start and develop a partnership Will be surprised if st max sees 60 mins never trained all week come on the toon,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Miggy is one of our most hardworking players and keeps being put on the bench. The end is near... I can see Miggy leaving soon. Let's see how many shots we have on target today. üéØüéØüòï,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Okey.. We have a okey lineup, but with Bruce to tell them how to play we are f*****. We have no plan. Doesnt want to play football. No movement. Fan from Norway, and every player in Norway runs more then newcastle players does.. i dont understand how they can not run. Bruce?",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
I don‚Äôt understand how Joelinton and Hendrick get a start ahead of Almiron. One of the more creative players we have. They better win this one. I‚Äôd take 1:0 right this second.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Don't agree with some of the choices made in the squad but guess in Bruce we trust for now at least.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"That‚Äôs not our strongest team at all.
Manquillo has been great recently
Miggy on the bench?
Hopefully I‚Äôm proven wrong as usual. Haha.",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
With us now you'll see after about 5 minutes how game is going to go.watched Leeds today how does Bielsa get them to play like that?passion energy an will to win?Bruce is doing ok but we havnt had a manager who has got us playing like a saw with Leeds today since Keegan.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Kraft doesn‚Äôt cut it for me. Manquillo over him any day. When fraser‚Äôs up to full fitness put him n ASM wide with Wilson in the middle of a 433,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Just be happy to see some shots on target and chances created.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
ALMIRON on the bench again. The man hasn't a clue how to play an attack I g formation. He's never done it. But one thing he's good at and that's taken teams down,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Hendrick playing on the wing where he doesn't like playing and miggy on the bench... Hard working team player quick and a real threat on the wing oh brucey you nearly picked a good team for once,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Do people actually watch our games? Big Joes been decent the past 3 games, get off the lads back man.",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Leeds have just drawn with man city, so with a win of 2 or more, the mighty toon army will go fifth..... Come on.",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Hope the manager and team just watched leeds game. Fantastic attacking football from both sides.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Everyone moaning about miggy being on the bench. I must be the only person who thinks he's useless. Yes his passion and his work rate are fantastic but his movement, passing and shooting are rubbish. I love the lads passion but as a footballer he's average at best",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Disappointed Almiron does not start, we need a big game from Shelvey tonight, he was very poor on Wednesday !!",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Bit of positivity anyone? Absolute drain reading 99% of these comments üôÑ,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
How can Emil Krath be getting into this starting 11. That‚Äôs beyond a joke he‚Äôs third choice right back in my eyes!!!,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Not feeling optimistic for this one... you have Almiron and Fraser who are arguably the quickest players to counter with (known how Bruce plays) and joelinton playing ahead of them wow üòÖ,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Leaving out either fraser or almairon for jolinton is a disgrace by the way.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Sorry but it‚Äôs not very often I criticise Bruce infact I like him as a manager. But no Almiron and manquillo who I‚Äôve thought has played pretty decent not playing is just asking for trouble! And he wonders why he gets criticised üôÑüôÑ,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
To me that looks like a 451 rather 442. Think Jolinton and ASM will both be wide.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Should be dropping shelvey not Miggy horrendous decision and no way should he have the armband with the shocking performances he's been putting in.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Why no start for Fraser yet again? I know he‚Äôs already played this week in the carabao cup but I‚Äôd pick him over Hendrick, just mind you.",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
No mobility in Centre Mid again. When will Bruce learn?,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

Has joelinton got something on Bruce ffs almiron on bench n that donkey starts upfront,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
think they have a lot to prove in todays game. so far we have seen flashes (very few) of great play but mostly we been shocking.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Just watching leeds attacking man city then will probably see us defending for 90 mins against bottom team Burnley reserves,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Almiron has been far more productive than joelinton! Yet on the bench Bruce doesn‚Äôt wanna attack teams,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
JoeLinton starting and front and center of the photo. Howay man! Sell him to Sunderland already!,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Nice attacking lineup. Would be happy with a 1-1 draw,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Decent, I still think shelvy should be dropped tho and play Hendrick cm and put almiron on behind Wilson, apart from the odd game and his passing now and again he just is to slow and lazy for cm in the prem dosent work hard enuff for the team.",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
He hasn‚Äôt got a clue this man he‚Äôs playing shelvey and all the players that get in behind are on the bench it‚Äôs guna be a case of playing a long ball and hoping something happens üòÇ,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

"I really dont think it matters what team we put out, I'm genuinely worried for us this season, no direction, no passion, no desire!!

If by some miracle we manage to stay up itll be by pure luck and the skin of our teeth and not by merit!!",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
No Fraser or almiron!! I bet almiron is sick of it now. Arguably our best player towards the end of the season and also arguably are best player this season,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Why not Almiron and Fraser? We have potentially one of the quickest forward lines in the premier League and he doesn't want to play them...very annoying.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
The FMB and his team selection is an absolute joke bar saint maximum there is no pace or creativity in the midfield why isn‚Äôt either almiron or Fraser starting,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Hardest working player on the bench yet again let's hope he understands he's our super sub when we're 2 down with 5 mins left to play poor miggy deserves more,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Murphy deserves a start after the way he‚Äôs played,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

Let's hope shelveys up for it tonight apart from the goal I thought he was quite last game,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
We'd best play all out attack because our defence is poor. 3-4-1-2 is the way forward.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Not bad. Would replace hendrick with Miggy. Hendrick has been poor in possession,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Apart from keeps I think this is our strongest team.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Why bench our best right back and one of our best midfielder almiron should not be benched not unless Bruce is using him tactically as a super sub when ya get tired legs but we will see,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
So we‚Äôre playing Hendrick on the wing again? Good. Good.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Hendrick cannot play on the wing, and we have 2 clear out and out wingers on the bench. Dont understand that choice myself but I'll I will give him until half time before I start really criticising üòÇ",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Why isn‚Äôt Almiron starting anymore? Let‚Äôs not be surprised when someone come knocking and he leaves,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
I would have played almiron rather than Hendrick,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Krafth üòë I don't understand what anyone sees in him liability on the ball liability off the ball I would rather play with 10 men,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

No Almiron no Longstaff is there a problem with Longstaff and why in his right mind would Almiron sit,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Loving it a more attacking formation and team he‚Äôs put out hope joelinton bangs a goal or 2 in,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Flat 4-4-2 by the looks of it probably matching up what Burnley are doing, personally not for me, but fraser and miggy will be huge if and when needed",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
I‚Äôm not a fan of krafth at all and we have zero creativity in that midfield as shelvey spends more time trying to get sent off. I hope joelinton does something in this game,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
I think tactically that's a good line up for today's game.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Miggy has been on form man works hard pace to hurt teams and he ain't getting played,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"What‚Äôs wrong with Bruce, no miggy again no Fraser but shelvey again, I‚Äôm pissed off before it‚Äôs even started",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Poor lineup once again. Might should play and shelvey should be on the bench.,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Bruce needs to go, Almiron must start instead of Joelinton, Hayden and Hendrick not good enough",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
"Good line up cmon the toon bring it home, almirion, Murphy and fraser to kill it off",38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

what is the formation for this match? 442 Again? with only 1 winger? Neither Hendrick nor Joelinton can play at the winger,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2
Why is it not Miggy on the right and Hendrick in instead of Shelvey?,38,Newcastle,Burnley,Home,2

"So Schar has a great game yet is dropped for lascelles who is dreadful

Makes sense",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Hendrick over Almiron or Fraser shows what a clown the manager is. Not surprised he chose him to be honnest. Almiron and Fraser would hurt the turtles at the back of ManU but the guy who needs to see that has not got a clue.,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Cannot believe Joe from Linton is picked before Fraser or Almiron. However... howay the lads!,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
"See a few people calling for Almiron but i am not sure he,s fit after being beaten up on International Duty for Paraguay üáµüáæ last week !",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3

Super sub carrrol and almiron rather have them come on than joelinton to win the game,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
"I‚Äôd of picked Almiron over Joelinton, but after thar dirty foul against him I‚Äôm happy to See Bruce rest him slightly.
I‚Äôm dying to see Wilson and Fraser in full swing together! Hopefully Darlow won‚Äôt need to do too much work.
Saint-Maximin for a goal and an assist for a goal for Wilson",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
"Defensive line up, should have a go at them with the form there in .",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
My opinion I would have Wilson up top Frazer ASM Almiron behind Hendrick offers nothing going forward,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Fraser and Almiron should be starting. Just paid 15 quid to watch this and we don't even have out best side out ü§¨ü§¨,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
I'd have put big Andy Carroll on from the start and told him to rough up their centre halves as they're low on confidence. Still got a good feeling about this match tho,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Needed to play Almiron instead of Joelinton and Fraser instead of Hendrick. Poor selection choices again... But I hope I‚Äôm proved wrong üò¨,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
There are better players that are on the bench or not on the team sheet,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Fraser on for joelinton come on I have nothing against the lad but let‚Äôs attempt a win,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
As long as there is no Matty longstaff as a man united fan am confident... That kid has been giving us problems,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Pretty strong line up ASM in front good stuff joelinton Hopefully confidence growing just my opinion.Would of been good for miggy start. Man u could pinch it Mr.Bruce c.mon lad sort it.,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Dropping Schar for Lascelles could be a mistake. Not understanding why he's not opting for Fraser or Miggy over Hendrick. We definitely need some pace on the right.,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
"Christ they haven't even kicked a ball and people are already slating them,let's get behind the lads who's starting the game.never know they might suprise us",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Would liked to have seen more pace Hendrick is not a right winger not keen on Krath either or Joelinton for that matter.Strong bench though.,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Why does he keep picking hendrick over fraser or almiron,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
"Wish Fraser would get a start! Dying to see the link up with him and Wilson! Especially when he scored and got motd midweek for Scotland! Would also like to see asm play behind Wilson in the hole, as think he‚Äôs more of a threat there (like where he scored the goal against Burnley) and can win set play‚Äôs in dangerous areas instead of out by the touchline as he gets his ankles kicked every time he receives the ball.",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Lascelles was a liability prior to injury. I‚Äôd have kept Schar. And Olly will have told his team to forget the Toon‚Äôs right side cos nothing will come down that side with Hendricks playing there. As usual he‚Äôll just drift into the middle. Put Almiron there FFS.,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
"Would of like to see Fraser in ahead of Hendricks to attack them down 2 flanks,but hay ho lets have a go .",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
"Absolutely buzzing that he's not going defensive with 5 at the back (for a change).. let's hope this team attacks united cause they are there for the taking.
Only change I would make from this 11 is Fraser in for joelinton, he's just came back off a decent international week.",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
"Where's the longstaff brothers? Made a big deal trying to get them to sign new contracts. :(
Games like this is where they have proven they are good enough.
Murphy should be starting aswell.",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Whys almiron not starting he should be up id probably of picked Fraser as well tbh but come on lads üôè,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Hendrick does nothing for me at rw fraser should be starting,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Wouldn't have Lascelles in at start,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Hendricks over a natural winger like Murphy or fraser deluded old clown.,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Would've liked to see Almiron on instead of Joelinton but hwtl,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
"Frightened to drop Joelinton ü§® Frazer or Almiron should be ahead of him, The price tag means he almost certainly going to start. We should have went full counter attacking with pace tonight ( mind you not watching it as refuse to pay PPv fees",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3

"I'd have Almiron in over Joelinton every day of the week. Starting to feel as though Bruce is under instruction to find a place for him given we wasted, sorry paid 40 million on him.
Don't get me wrong, he hasn't done badly since he moved out wide, but I'd rather have ASM out there and Almiron on the other side.",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Why is hendrick getting into the team above almiron!,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Why is Jeff Hendrick playing every game at RW?,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
"How many more chances is Joelinton going to get, might as well play with 10 men, would have Schar in for Lascelles hes our version for Maguire, disappointed Fraser not getting a start",47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Like the lineup. Joelinton has improved big time the past few matches now he‚Äôs being used more in midfield. He needs to pass a lot more in the final third though.,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Wrong move schar should have stayed ü§¨,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
No Almiron or Fraser...why?,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Murphy or Miggy over Hendrick any day of the week,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3

Why don't you start almiron,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3
Shame for Fraser. He deserves the start over Joelinton.,47,Newcastle,Man Utd,Home,-3

Surely having him pick out Wilson without looking paid dividends whilst they were together at Bournemouth. He can actually cross the ball accurately when others cannot.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Are there actually any positive people on here or just people wanting to hate on Bruce and the team.
We are where we are and will continue to be until Ashley goes.
He wouldn't get rid of Bruce unless we were in danger of relegation which we aren't.
Get behind them man ffs",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Very much improved at least we had a go it was not boring glad I was wrong next week ???,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Just wish Lewis would show some confidence and run forward with the ball rather than moving forward and checking back and passing backwards,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
5 at the back yet again!! For God‚Äôs sake Bruce stop using this useless formation! It doesn‚Äôt work. Yet another 90 plus minutes of sitting back and giving up possession until we inevitably concede goals! Great tactics Bruce! They‚Äôve worked so well before!,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Fraser on the bench could be useful. But I honestly still think we won't get anything out of this match...we always struggle against Everton. Especially at home.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Think it‚Äôs probably best line up he could pick. Will be interesting to see how Bruce plays them...hopefull
y wingbacks pushing on not just sitting back. Hayden and Fraser to get some playing time hopefully.",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"So Fraser and Wilson linked up well at Bournemouth, so instead of capitalise on it, Bruce constantly leaves fraser on the bench or plays him out of position. Clueless manager.",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Jeff Hendrick offers nothing. Would have had Hayden in for Hendrick, 4 at the back with Fraser coming in for schar who has been poor",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
5 at the back shocking let's defend defend defend and create about 3/4 chances then. The boys are better than you allow them to be!!!,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
I‚Äôm sure we set up similar last week and we were dreadful,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
We not playing 5 at the back. It's a 3-4-3 formation. Murphy and Lewis gonna play as wing backs with S Longstaff and Hendrick anchoring the midfield with Almiron and ASM supporting Wilson,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Again with 5 at the back at home.. shocking,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
3 at the back against one striker never works. Was hopeful today but not now,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Good old 5 at the back at home with 2 defensive midfielders guess we re going for a draw again,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"That's slightly better, atleast Hendrick and Longstaff can work together to hold the midfield.
However 5 at the back again is bleeding infuriating! It doesn't work Bruce, learn from your darn mistakes!",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Let's be honest if it wasn't for the front three that looks like a championship team.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Due to injuries/ suspensions they have no players who can do run at us , dribble past with pace. Surely need to get at them today and play attacking",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Could have lost by a bigger margin - A common theme I‚Äôve noticed myself saying lately. Might as well put it out before the game.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"My heart sinks when I see Hendrick in the line up, he's been anonymous since the opening game, surely Hayden was a better bet than him, no Fraser dear me.",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
How the hell does lascelles get a start got to be one of our worst defenders. Bruce going for a bore draw.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"With those players I'd do 3 cb's, wing backs pushing forward, Hendrick and Longstaff in the centre, with Almiron and ASM behind Wilson. But Bruce will likely do it 5 at the back, Almiron in centre with the other two and ASM behind Wilson but with empty space ahead them as we won't get that far up the pitch",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"What a surprise...anot
her 5-4-1 snooze fest from Bruce. Can‚Äôt wait to see us have 1 shot all game",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"They have Richarlison and Lucas Digne are both suspended whilst James Rodriguez and Seamus Coleman are out injured, Pickford dropped - surely we have to take advantage of this and not defend all game !",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Good thing Everton will be without James Rodriguez but switched their keeper after Pickford's previous meeting blunder,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Hendrick has been playing dreadful i personally wouldn't start him,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Playing at home and just trying not to lose, again üôÑ",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Hayden should be in there straight away,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
How can he pick hendrick over hayden!?,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"5 at the back, I can tell you now how this is going to go. Sit back and just let them come at us",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Looking at their line up, there is no reason why we can‚Äôt win today. Sorry one reason, cabbage heeed.",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Hendricks was dreadful last game, doesn‚Äôt bring anything to the team. Would have Hayden over him all day",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
What the hell is Hayden sitting on the bench,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Is Hendrick Bruce‚Äôs love child his obsession with him is like rafas with Perez he‚Äôs been dreadful all season and still gets a start. Get Fraser on from the start,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Hayden and Fraser on bench man hasn‚Äôt a clue,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
I can't see how Hendrick is in the team. üò°,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Ooooof no no no Sean and hendricks in centre mid it‚Äôs a park the bus job again ffs man saying that Everton are a good side so I‚Äôd be happy with a point,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
One win in 5 is not good enough. 3 points is a must today.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
So Fraser played great last game so doesn‚Äôt start üëåüèª,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Decent I like it. Pleased to see Almiron getting a start.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Never like to complain, but if Hayden is fit enough for the bench, then why ain‚Äôt he starting. Midfield worries me, not much dynamism/
mobility in there",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Hayden with one leg plays before Hendrick. Other than that, not a bad team. HWTL",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Can‚Äôt wait for the exciting run of play! Oh wait..... 5 in the back....,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Come on lads let‚Äôs get at them and get the result,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
10 at the back 1 up front üôà,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Two good cm and a rwb away from a decent side that,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Fingers crossed we get a draw,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Stop playing Hendrick man,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"why has he named his favourite donkey in the starting line again, the invisible man Hendrick",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Are you sure we are at home Everton have depleting team looks like another boring 90mins,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Hayden just recover from injury. Looking again to an another 5-3-2 defensive formation. Park the bus again. Anti football.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Pity about Pickford being dropped - that would have been a two goal start,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
So basically 5 at the back and sitting back,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Not even interested anymore...its too boring to sit through 90mins.....I'll
just catch up on MOD like the old days üò°",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Here comes another 90 mins of camping in our own half.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
At least the albatross is not playing. Fight boys fight.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Back 5 isn‚Äôt a bad thing if the wingbacks push high up,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
I know I‚Äôm in the minority but for me Hendrick is a far better midfielder than Hayden,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
We get a quality player like Fraser and the clown refuses to play him. Get out of our club bacon face ffs.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Looks to be another 30% possession time. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
zz",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Wilson on his own upfront isolated again for another 90 mins while ASM tries to run midfield alone and everyone else sits back,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"It's a depressing squad ain't it üò≠üò≠ from tino, shearer speed Lee etc etc to this lot can't Evan pass the ball forward half of them üôà",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Prickford benched hahaha England‚Äôs number 1?!...aye right! ü¶ñü¶ñ,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
5 at the back again,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"He hasn‚Äôt tried joelinton at centre half yet, we will find that ¬£40 mil player somewhere",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Love all the sausages predicting calamity. Plonkers,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Why did we keep Matty if he isn't even going to make the bench? He's fully fit now,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Park the bus from kick off again,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Why have a right back on the bench when you can play Murphy? Because that makes total logical sense,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Would have hayden in there instead of Longstaff or Hendrick.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
1 change for me take hendrick out and play Hayden,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
don't no y he won't swap longstaf for Hendrick keep Fraser on for the attacking option,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Hayden must be injured because he‚Äôs out best CM by a mile. Is it a 5-3-2?,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Matty longstaff will be wondering why did he even bother signing a new contract if Bruce never puts him in the side!,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Like the look of this team lets see how we set up..attack attack attack..,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Guy, guys. It's not 5 at the back. Its 9 at the back",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
What is the latest on Yedlin?,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Not bad front 3 at all.
Bet he still has 10 men behind the ball. üôÑ",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
People may laugh at this but I just feel like it‚Äôs joelintons day for a goal or 2...,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Noooo not Lascelles üò¢ another defeat then,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Wtf is this line up...
Why not
Darlow
Schar lascelles Fernandez
Murphy Hayden Lewis
Fraser almiron ASM
Wilson",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Where‚Äôs all them fickle fans before KO. Same boring negative doyles,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Hahahaha no pick ford for Everton. Only makes the bench,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
A win today ? Please ?,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"2 wing backs,2 central midfielders,1 each side of Wilson.
A balance looking formation.
Here‚Äôs hoping üñ§ü§ç",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Is that 3-5-2?,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Another exciting afternoon for Wilson........üôÑhwtlüí™üí™,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1

vipaji vipo ihembe njoo HUKU MNAKWAMA WAPI Ado Damian,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Haway lads we can do it,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Hendrick and Lascelles should be nowhere near our starting 11,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Decent line up if used correctly,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
BRUCE OUT! Another horrible performance,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Shame the Toffees have dropped the Mackem clown ü§°,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
What has Fraser got to do !!,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Was hoping lascelles would be injured for rest of the season,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Come on Newcastle,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Still rather have Fraser in there but decent !!,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Can't wait to defend all game then lose üëç,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
I'm not happy with either of them,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
I like that starting 11,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
never ceases to amaze me--Mr Bruce.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
It football not chess !! HWTL ‚öΩÔ∏è,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Defend for 80 minutes then give up...,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Surely Hayden isn't fit because why would he drop him ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Fraser and hayden should be starting,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Well i never. Joey isnt playing.,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"If ASM puts that chance away Bruce's tactics would have been spot on. Also someone needs to tell longstaff he's not on the bench now, and can get involved.",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
90 mins of defending,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Uggghhh, 5 at the back again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ffs",67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Hendrick for hayden then thats a better 1st 11,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
"Ball position: 30s: 60s

Vamos almir√≥n hoy Newcastle vamos almir√≥n üíØüí™üáµüáæ,67,Newcastle,Everton,Home,1
Just watched Fulham they are as bad as us but they tried hard all afternoon chased everything don't know what Brucie says to our team but they look a yard off the pace don't close down don't get me wrong but Chelsea are good but we should of done better there second goal was a replica of the one Man its scored against us really hope Bruce goes am afraid he's lost the dressing room üò°,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Bruce conceded before the match that we could not compete with the quality of Cheasea. Hence park the bus again. What message does this send to the players? Beaten before they have kicked a ball and this shows the mentality on the pitch.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"I agree with Frank Law, but Steve Bruce isn't getting enough out of these players. To be honest, it makes me wonder what Steve Bruce actually does on the training ground week in week out, not much judging by our totally inept performances. Very poor Head Coach to say the least, but who else would want to work for Mike Ashley. Fingers crossed for a takeover.",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Bruce is killing the team and passion.
I thought it was bad enough having FCB as a owner but these 2 together are draining my will to watch the mags.
Gutted the way the team are playing under Bruce. üòîüòî",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
I have followed Newcastle since the late 70's and I have never seen a manager ruin a team and and play such tedious football well done Steve Bruce,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Think I'd rather they gave it a go and got relegated than play like this every week. It's meant to be entertainment after all. Joelinton is the worst bit of business I've ever seen. He cant find the 18 yard box, let alone the goal.",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Newcastle United is playing such a boring game that it deserves to be relegated... At least have a go at it... Learn something from Leeds United.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
To bring our beloved Newcastle Utd back is a new ownership and manager. Simple As! Untill then sadly my expectations of being joyful and ecstatic is reaching top 10 or 9 at the standard were at! ‚ö´‚ö™‚ö´‚ö™ despite all that... always back the lads week in week out üëäüëçü§û,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Bruce is devoid of any attacking intent ..championship manager at best ü§°,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Not good for us! We've clearly invited Chelsea into our half. If this is the theme, defense, I c no reason y schar remains on d bench",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Can't see us doing very well attacking wise, without Wilson, we do have a good record in this fixture but Chelsea have great players this season.",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
If we have any chance at all we have to show some urgency and high press if we sit back and let them dictate the play they will run us ragged. We can only hope and pray.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Doesn‚Äôt make much difference who plays, Chelsea just have better players in every position, Only hope is, to work our socks off and hope we get a break, simple facts are, non of our players would be regulars in the Chelsea team, regardless of who is the manager, we will be just making up the numbers, until there is a change of ownership, but I agree, at least have a go.‚öΩÔ∏è",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Good defenders and one exciting attaching player in St Max. May be we can get a point but who cares, football is meant to be about entertainment. How is Almiron on the bench. We will loose our third best player if Bruce does not play him üòû",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
5 defenders and 2 holding midfielders. And a turnip up front. Can't wait for this,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
I don‚Äôt mind getting beat to a quality team!! But lately what I can‚Äôt stand is the manner of the way we play and getting beat!!,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"We will sit back let Chelsea have the ball ,let Chelsea do what they want,put no pressure on to get ball back, this is gunna be a big win for Chelsea,,almiro
n will come on with 10 minutes to go,,",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"It looks like another day of sitting back and 2 shots on goal for us.
Im not even looking forward to watching it.
This really has depressed me.
He hasn't had much choice. But Carroll instead of Joilinton surely should have been the choice up front",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
We don't stand a chance be lucky if we get in there half with that team no attacking anywhere!,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"The first game im not working! This is going to be a long, painful 90 minutes",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
I‚Äôll be surprised if we score a goal to be honest looking like we‚Äôll be very lucky to get a draw and they will have to play out of their skins to get any kind of result,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Wilson n Fraser hamstrings? Almiron jetlagged so bringing on later. We have no choice but hit on the break n that's why defensive setup. I don't think we can do anything else.
Joelinton comes good today üòÇ no chance but anything possible.
We're 3 points off 5th lol. Chelsea",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"We are playing ultra defensive football every game, hurts",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Is it worth watching might get over half way line 2 times,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Depressing team sheet. Zero chance of a goal. 90 minutes of 9 behind the ball and hope we snatch a goal and a point. Pisses me right off. Chelsea 75% possession and 20 shots today at least I reckon. Donkeylinton my oh my,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Longstaff 35yd shot, clipping Big Joe on the way through to open the scoring, then sit back.

Well that's how SB dreamed it going last night!",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Today‚Äôs possession stats Newcastle 15% Chelsea 85%. Will we cross the half way line?,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Doesnt matter which players he puts out, as long as Steve Bruce is still the manager, we can expect the same type of boring defensive performance today.",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"I think Bruce should play Oz, Dennis, Neville, Bomber, Wayne, Barry and Moxey.
If he want to got all out defensive they could put a wall up in no time!",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Oh dear......... obviously if we can nick a point that would be awesome but this side is set up to defend. Big Joe won‚Äôt see the ball (like that makes a difference) and they‚Äôll snuff out Murphy and ASM.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Only good thing about this line up is I've got a few player from Chelsea in my dreamteam,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"I knew Wilson wouldn‚Äôt be involved and as I thought Joelinton comes in, with the players available best line up he could play really",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Great to see Clark back. Pleased Hendrick has been dropped. Shame Wilson failed his fitness test. Would of started Carroll over Joelinton. Great to see Hayden too, back where he belongs.",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Never seen so many defenders in one team...confiden
t for a win then.üòÇüòÇüòÇ",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
I‚Äôll be surprised and delighted if we get anything out of this game.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
That team would struggle in the championship,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
I hope manquillo and Lewis run the wings and not pass back all the time!,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
im going to say 7-0 win for chelsea our squad looks poor at best today defensive tactics for certain and no goalinton upfront im going to watch paint dry instead!!!,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
With this squad no creativity so no chance at all. Glad to see Manquillo and Clark back to drop Schar and Hendrick.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Nice to see Krafth is back in the teamüòç,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
I'm happy enough with this team given the injuries exc we have had,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Not the most attack minded side or not looking like we will have a go with that line up, but no Hendrick that‚Äôs a massive bonus.",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
When Hendrick is on the bench,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
If Wilson injured we won't score. Hope I am wrong but he has reverted to Joelinton up top more or less on his own. Chelsea must be pissing themselves when they see this teamsheet. Yet again Almiron on bench can't blame him wanting away under this disaster of a so called manager.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Front foot, progressive football he said. Three windows and the ""squad"" is worse. #bruceout",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Wow, 5 at the back, no midfielder who can pick a pass out and a striker who cant score. Looks like another long 90mins of watching the other team pass the ball around .",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Awful game ahead with that line up. Why can‚Äôt we just have a go. Gonna watch Newcastle Falcons instead. This will depress me,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"5 defenders. Excellent, sit back let them come at us and if we get a lucky break away then so be itüëç I take it that's the game plan",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Why do we persist on having Joelinton in the matchday squad...we cant afford any passengers...it
s like we are 1 man down straight away...fingers crossed for another striker coming through in January.",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"defending for our lives for 90 minutes... considering not watching, why ruin another day?",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Absolutely horrific. 5 at the back at home - clueless.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Thats got to be up there with one of the worst premier league lineups in a long time,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Chelsea has to win irrespective of how you'll line up üòÄ,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"It doesn‚Äôt matter how we line up the tactics are exactly the same
Sit back and hopefully sneak a goal",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Sick of seeing the ball being passed back. Kick it into their half. Make them work,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"No one in that side that's going to support JL, ASM and Jacob Murphy wide me longstaff and Hayden holding midfield this it the problem when playing with wing backs ASM is wasted he will spend a lot of time drifting in field to try and support JL",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Wouldn't be surprised if we get hammered here, Chelsea will win but buy how many is worrying",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Lascelles and Fernandez partnership is an extremely coward. Attacking rhythm is always broken by their passing the ball each other at the back.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Another defensive set up , negative Bruce ! Team talk before every game, ‚Äú you lot are not good enough to match football , so let‚Äôs be defence and try catch them on break ! ‚Äú boring as fcuk ti watch !",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Not sure we gonna get any points from Lampard, but I hope we put up a good fight and I think Bruce never will...",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Defensively minded. Hope Hayden and Joe Lintin can perform,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Just need a bit positivity get the ball in the box big joe will at least go for Ariel duels not quick enough to get in behind,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Who really thinks will beat Chelsea. I‚Äôd love for us to win but same games you have to write off . Chelsea should be too good for us,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Nice to see we have gone for it with an attacking team selection of 11 behind the ball üò≠üò°,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Total rubbish...... players are at best mediocre ( with a couple of exceptions) and Bruce is clueless....,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
This line up highlights the serious corner cutting in the transfer market over the past few years (and more). Uninspiring to say the least.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
My 13 old lad just summed it up! ‚ÄòThe Chelsea keeper is playing a higher line than our defence....‚Äô,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"I thoroughly expect this excuse for a manager to go one step further soon by announcing in a team sheet "" GOALKEEPERS behind a back 8 with one up front with a licence to help defensively!!!!
!",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Another all out attacking formation from Bruce, surprised he‚Äôs dropped hendick mind, he‚Äôs been nothing but inspirational",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Will be lucky to get anything out of the game today but hopefully prove everyone wrong,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Would of played Carroll not Joe,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
When were you ever taught to sit backü§£ü§£ü§£. Best form of defense is Attack,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
I wonder if we let ASM up front on his own what it would be like,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
why the hell do they keep putting us on tv.do the tv companies really hate us that much.this team is a disgrace to the toon.thank god darlow likes to keep busy ü§¨ü§¨üò±üò±üëéüëé,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"As the massive underdogs, let's just give it a go today please Steve! Let's not defend from kick off. Pressure pressure pressure!",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"I hope joelinton spoils the party today and does something
Don‚Äôt mind the selection for this game just if we go behind early we bolloxed",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Cabbage heed by not playing Wilson has conceded this game straight away, he said he was fit ,but ???",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"There's a team screaming attacking play, lots of possession and goals.... For Chelsea!",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Looks like a park the bus. Shocking,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Glad Clark is playing think he gives us a bit bite at the bk,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
I was donating blood plasma to fight Covid 19 this morning 8AM. Barrack road. I could see the top of St. James park. I thought WHY?,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Any one of Chelsea reserves would get into our first team.. Says it all!,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Are they playing home or away. Wow steve Bruce really playing negative football with a squad that can win games and even upset big teams. Clearly Castle United need a new manager,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
I am not deluded at all todays performance shows how worrying our tactics are. We didn‚Äôt try.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"It's against 1 of the top 6 team's so Defend all game, no chance of scoring, he's put janelinton upfront when we've got Carroll on the bench.",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Going down with bruce in charge mate,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Park the bus till they score then open up and let in another one! Chelski didn‚Äôt have to try at all!,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
How many shots will jokelinton have? Im going to say 0,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
The useless Brazilian again. Can't even score on a dartboard.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Set up / performance / result - so predictable. Must be the worst team to watch in the premier league ‚òπ,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Got a feeling its gonna be a long 90min. Defending is the order of the day with that team out..fear the worst if Chelsea turn it on..,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"I can see it now, we'll get a lucky 1-0 lead then try to defend it for 70 odd minutes an end up losing 4/5- 1",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Don't think we'll score with this line up unless bit of magic from Maxi or centre back from corner!either way sorry to say not looking good!,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Glad to see clark back. Can see us frustrating them by sitting back so cud steal a win or draw,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Yes it was,it was a struggle to stay awake the full 90min.Bruce must go.",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"I‚Äôd rather play ASM through the middle and Miggy on the wing, at least a threat in behind seen as we‚Äôre gonna defend for 89 mins",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Finally no Hendrick and Hayden playing,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Christ we in for a battering - should play Carroll instead of Jolintocrap,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"4-0 Chelsea, anything better than this is a bonus",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Their midfield will completely dominate oursüò¢,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Why so many defenders every game, absolute joke",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Easy afternoon for the Chelsea centre halves.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
No wonder almiron wants to leave.. 2nd most expensive signing and can't get a start.. Bruce is a cabbaged heeded dyde,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Schar should be starting. As should clark.

One of the other 2 empty heads at the back need to be dropped",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Got know midfielders with any football brain don't know how to pass or find space the team's always find space ü§îü§îü§î,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
5 defenders... Bruce is cheep.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
5 at the back ü§£ can't wait to not watch this,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
In for a hammering here like bruce has no idea what hes doing,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"No matter how you lined up, the victory is sure for us.up Chelsea",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Where is yedlin?,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"That's actually not a bad line up, would rather almiron start but rather Joel than Carroll up top HOWAY THE LADS",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Chelsea will be rubbing their hands, come on Bruce ffs, looks like we are going for the draw",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Had us to get beat today 100% sure now after seeing the line up,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Would rather play S√∂rensen instead of Joelinton. Cant be worse.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Jolinton up front on his own?? Is Bruce all there in the head?,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
"Predictions lads? For me it‚Äôs 4-0 to Chelsea. No chance against a team of that quality, not with Brainless Bruce‚Äôs tactics of just sitting back all game.",87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Shelvey and miggy on the bench cant see us getting a goal today,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
Didn‚Äôt need it anyway but if you did? More proof that Bruce is absolutely clueless,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2
So Wilson not even made the bench.,87,Newcastle,Chelsea,Home,-2

Is Asm injured ?,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
"You have to look at the clip that Andy Carrol is man.

50 grand a week to run round a field and, let's face it, live in a 4 million pound pad, yet never kicks a football in real life.

WTF is going on.",118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
the best we can ask for really considering the Covid cases ... personally i would put Murphy in the starting 11 in place of Ritchie to add that extra pace. 3 - 1 toon win,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
Am very optimistic. When Matt n shelvey r in am always sure that we fight to our best to get a result. Though skeptical about Joels presence,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1

"Predict 3-1 win, Wilson 2 and Gayle to come off the bench to score",118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
Could he not have put Krafth as CB (he hasn‚Äôt really put a foot wrong when he‚Äôs been asked to play there) and have Yedlin/Murphy as RB. Would rather have had Hayden freed up for the midfield.,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1

Is fraser made of glass?,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
Not bad barring the slug being Centre and Kraft starting ahead of Murphy...,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
"Perfect game for Almiron to free himself up and get around the pitch, assuming Bruce doesn't want him as an out and out winger ü§î",118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
I‚Äôm glad Hendricks has been dropped and at least we still have Clark. Let‚Äôs hope they put a good shift in today with Ritchie being back,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
Better than what everyone was expecting after Bruce's press conference,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
Not much at back can see West Brom going for it,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
"1 CB fit and yet we've loaned out a first team CB in Lejuene, still makes zero sense",118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
Hopefully see Joelinton play with confidence!,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
"Langley getting a first team slot is good, Gillespie probably one of the players who got covid",118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
Only disappointment for me is Shelvey and captain as well. Hope he shows a bit more than last couple of games he's played,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
I dont understand what formation hes playing with with that team ü§î,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
That‚Äôs not bad considering we have people out with Covid. We better start on the attack and not sit back against a poor West Brom.,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
Hayden at the back we recon??,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
Hayden centre back come on toon,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
So I‚Äôm guessing mainly defenders who are still isolating etc?,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
Thankfully Hendrick is on the bench. Let‚Äôs hope he stays there,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1
That isn't that bad really. Especially due to outbreak.,118,Newcastle,West Brom,Home,1

What a lump of lard Joelinton is - might as well put a cardboard cut out on the pitch. Surely better options in line up available - Bruce hasn‚Äôt got a clue what his best side is ! Almiron back to wasting chances - ffs put your laces through your shots ! Another poor performance for me - another get out of jail free performance !,137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
Most of these players should be playing Middlesbrough or Sunderland. They are NOT capable of playing in the PL,137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
"Why on earth is Longstaff playing after that debacle of a performance against Leeds, easily the worst player on the pitch",137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
Going to regret not playing gayle from the start possibly. Deserves a start at least he can score unlike joelinton,137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
Why do they insist on playing joelinton forget his price tag he shouldn't be anywhere near the team and don't get me started with Longstaff has been terrible lately,137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
if im honest am not liking our back 4 :( or long staff and we need ASM back asap actually not looking forward to this match at all,137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
"Pleased Hayden not playing, he looked knackered at Leeds, needs rest after COVID",137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
"Good to see Dummett back as Lewis has been dreadful recently. Not sure how Longstaff had kept his place. And as for Joelinton......
.",137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
"Guessing Hayden needs a rest. Longstaff has been dreadful of late and playing with no confidence, but always looks a tiny bit better with Shelvey at his side, we will see.",137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
Glad weve started Almiron and shelvey. Longstaff should of been dropped after the last game and not Hayden. Lewis needed to be dropped lost his form but still a good player when he settles! C'mon lads easy 3 points tonight.,137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
"Where to start gk and cb‚Äôs have been good, good to see Dummett back but who knows how sharp he is yedlin is hit and miss let‚Äôs hope he‚Äôs good today wings have potential to do well glad the shelvey back in passing is our worst attribute as a team Hayden deserves to start over longstaff but we know he can play well with shelvey and joelinton has been improving recently but I feel like Gayle deserves a start to see what he can offer playing the majority of a game but that‚Äôs just my two cents mon the toon these are the games you have to be winning at home",137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
What is it about Joelinton? He should not be in the squad never mind the team. If Bruce won‚Äôt drop him them Bruce himself needs to go.,137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
Am season ticket at newcastle for past 10 years and more to be honest can't wait to see the back of bruce,137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
"Matty must wonder how he can‚Äôt get a game over his brother. People act like it‚Äôs a vendetta against Sean but it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs simple logic that you can‚Äôt afford to carry a central midfielder every week.
I hope he has a great game tonight but it‚Äôs hard not to be cynical when he‚Äôs been beyond poor all season long.",137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0
"Good to see Dummett back coz Lewis isn't performing at all. I'd have had Hayden over Longstaff all day long coz he's been poor for us too.
Gayle is a goalscorer and although Joelinton hasn't done too badly of late, I'd have preferred to have Gayle up top with Wilson.",137,Newcastle,Fulham,Home,0

Bruce just doesn‚Äôt get it. These 9 at the back setups fail each and every time. Damaged limitations right from the off.

Ready for the toon too dominate possession... play free flowing attacking football and just completely dominate through the middle of the field... toon by 3+... it‚Äôs the last day of 2020 anything could happen.... but if we even get a point or manage to lose by less than 3 I‚Äôll take that as a win,157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Home,0

Under circumstances a reasonable line up but BRUCE the all shitey needs to let them have a go. I'd have had Gayle in instead of the awful Joelinton.

"Hello Reds, and hello Mr. Klopp...
Oh this world has bigger problems than a draw vs West Brom from a team that is on top of the league - so calm down and enjoy your matchday, i am sure the guys will give their best to get these three important points.
Great to see Mr. Alc√°ntara on the bench - so good luck for the guys and Mr. Klopp and all the best for Mr. van Dijk and for the fantastic fans of LFC.
Heja BVB...",157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Away,0
"Jones gives the corner away that led to us drawing the last game. Starts today. Minamino plays out of his skin, gets dropped for two games now, doesn‚Äôt make sense to me but I trust you know what you‚Äôre doing Kloppy lad. Come on Red Men.",157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Away,0
When will he learn that Jones isn't good enough to play from the start...no attacking influence in midfield tonight could be a long night for our forwards ( hope I'm proved wrong ) YNWA,157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Away,0
"Good to see Phillips being given another chance. I feel sorry for both him and Williams as every time they finally get a start, they have a good game and then get dropped. As Williams was great again Kane and Spurs. Didn't loom out of place and then hasn't started since",157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Away,0
"The lineup is starting to look much healthier, and truthfully, the time given to the younger lads has instilled a lot more confidence in them, at least with me. It was the senior players I've been worried about. Lackadaisical lately to say the least.",157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Away,0
Milner is a great player. Jones is another level just needs time. Great starting line up with ox coming on for Jones and thiago on for hendo in 2nd half will be a game changer,157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Away,0

"Tonight is not a game for playing Curtis, not after the WBA game. Need experience on the pitch to get a result and get them back on track. Draw is no good and a resurgent Man U on the horizon as potential partypoopers of the home record.",157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Away,0
"Amazing how many pricks are on here slating Jones now, the kids just starting to setting in the 1st team and bell ends here want to break the kids already,YNWA üòÇ what a joke, most don‚Äôt know the meaning",157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Away,0
"Perfect game to start ox instead of Jones as it‚Äôs a big pitch, but hopefully Jones can actually have some end product to his game in this one. We are now clearly lacking pace at the back, so Wilson‚Äôs channel running will be a clear threat if he plays on Phillips. Our fire power has to be clinical",157,Newcastle,Liverpool,Away,0
"Jones should get 45... just To see if he learned sth from wba. He must not take 30 touches moving the ball 2 meters. If so shift for Ox in 2nd..!! If we are still not ahead with 30 left Thiago can make the difference in playmaker role instead of hendo aswell. With thiago fit there is no way we are not up 3-0 against wba after 1st.

Milner worked real good, but he should have been subbed earlier.

Arnold was the flop from our side. No complete pass nor cross.

Mane was busy pissing around. Indecision was his problem.

Salah ate all our chances like carrots.

Kudos to Henderson. He held that midfield till Thiago showed up.
Kudos to both Philp and Fabinho. They were very focused.
Kudos to Robertson, Thiago, Gini and Bobby. Very dedicated.
Thanks to Alison. We could have gotten nothing.

"I'd liked to of seen Gayle play along side Wilson.
Also agree Sean has been very poor this season. But this may spark him into life playing along side Matty. ü§îü§û
HWTLS.",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
What on earth has Bruce brought in Sean Longstaff I think that this season he has proved that he is a liability just hope that he doesn‚Äôt give the game away as he has done in the past by losing the ball in possession or dwelling on it for too long & getting taken off him to easily,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Joelinton shouldn't be any where near the 1st team...Sean Lonsgstaff needs a big performance as he has been shocking... maybe playing along side little brother will help,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"Would have much preferred Gayle instead of Joelinton, but tbh, how we play, is more down to the tactics (or usual lack of) rather than the players. I would love us to put the same sort of effort as we did against Liverpoo, but I am sure that we will play deep and just hope.",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Correct me if wrong but hasn't Matty Longstaff been injured for a long time? Just listening to the Sky guys saying how he has not shown the promise since that cracker against Man Utd.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Surprised he keeps on playing Big Joelinton got to be worth playing someone with a bit movement and a bit speed ....Carrol maybe,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
1 upfront at home. Playing for the draw again Bruce.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Not a fan of joeliton but give him a bit of credit done well lately holding the ball up n getting some possession for us don't like Ritchie as wing back to much ball watching but other than that not a bad starting line up,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"I wish Miggy would work on just playing on the wing and crossing the ball anywhere in the box for Wilson to attack.

He seems too desperate to run into the box and putting pressure on himself to score.

Get it in the box then it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs problem",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"I‚Äôm starting to wonder if Joelinton has a specific clause in his contract that says he needs to play every week, else we owe him double wages.
The lofty, Samson-like Goliath that is Andy Carroll would be my preference, but then he‚Äôs as brittle as an octogenarian Nun‚Äôs hymen.",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
How does Joe Linton get his place over Gayle,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"Surely now an energetic midfield, 2nd best pick without suspended hayden",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Surely jokelinton needs a rest üëÄüò´ would rather shelvey in there instead of sean aswell,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
We desperately need some quality midfielders and fullbacks if we are ever going to compete. Have not had a class act in the middle since Cabaye. That said Wilson looks a real player if he gets enough supply.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"Must be in his contract that joelinton starts, he‚Äôs a waste of space sorry but he is, Gayle would do much better at even holding ball up and better in air. Even Carroll for me.",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Hope none of the players read this. So much for fans getting behind the team. Slagging players off before they even have played,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"People asking for shelvey need to start watching what shelvey actually does during the games which is very little, the odd great pass does not deserve a starting place if he worked hard I could understand but he dosent even try has no pace no goal threat no strength in the box just pure lazyness",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Hopefully Sean feels the need to perform when he is playing with his younger brother,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
I'm all for giving him a chance Sean Longstaff needs to step up today and change fans opinions of him he's been very poor this season so far! Hoping for a change in attitude again HWTL,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"Longstaffs can't play together. Sean doesn't have the discipline. He pulls Matty about the pitch leaving us too exposed. This was proven against this lot last year, we were lucky not to concede 10 goals at their place.",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Bruce you got given credit for the Liverpool game and now you put S Longstaff back in the team. We have an idiot as manager.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"Maybe matty brings the best out of Sean, who knows.. this should be the decider at least, if Sean doesn‚Äôt have a decent game minimum here, he‚Äôs GOT to be dropped.",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1

Almiron these are not going to be enough to stop Leicester I feel you can just carry matty just at times but all 3 .....no ,Sean has been terrible every game he plays sorry can only see this going one way",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
The way Joelinton played the first half we may as well play with 10 men,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Same side as liverpool only Sean Longstaff for Hayden hes going to have to start working gives me the impression that he wants to be away but Bruce hasn't any other options.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"Not a bad starting 11 to be honest, considering the recent injuries and illness",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Where is Jamal Lewis and why isn‚Äôt he making the team no more,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Murphy for Sean. Why doesn't Gayle ever get a look in? Surely he can't be worse than Joelinton.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
5-4-1 .... at home... Bruce is a dinosaur.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
might spark a reaction out of sean if alongside his bro like. ü§û,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
How is joelinton getting picked every game ? Hes as much use as the popes cock. Must be showing it in training ...¬£40m ? Who scouted this dud ??,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Only reason we aren't bottom is Darlow. He'll be sold soon.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Why does he not play shelvey with matty ..,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Shaun Longstaff over Shelvey ü§¢,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
How does Sean long staff keep getting a game üòÇ,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Think I‚Äôd rather have Murphy start over Sean longstaff!!,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Apart from Darlow we have no outstanding players at all ... we are punching above our weight with the lucky points we have and if that luck runs out it‚Äôs yet another relegation battle .... just saying like,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"Bruce has no authority over anything but the defenders. Almiron could be a winger if Bruce chose to mould him into that creative player with his pace. Joelinton can‚Äôt be moulded into anything, how Gayle cannot be starting alongside Wilson is beyond me, at Wilson would have a willing runner to play alongside.",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Why let Elliot Anderson train with the 1st team and not even put him on the bench. Bruce us messing with his confidence. Should of been left with the u23 where he was playing good and getting game time,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Would of been better for shelvey in longstaff out and push Gayle up front with Wilson.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"Decent team that, glad to see Matty Longstaff getting some form, hopefully his brother will follow. Schar Fernandez Clark best defenders at the club.",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Miggy needs to step up a gear on his performances so far this season. Hopefully today,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"For me, the line up is kinda irrelevant ... it's how the team actually approach the game today that's more important. If they approach like they did Liverpool and show a bit of fight, all good ... if they don't and just revert to 20% possesion and let Leicester use us for target practice and pray Darlow has another worldie, then the performance against Liverpool seems almost pointless.",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Time to start Krafth? Three starts this season: two wins and got substituted at 1-1 vs Man Utd.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
I can't help but feel if joelinton had been a success and banged in 20 goals he would always be injured or suspended instead he is always available and seemingly the only player not needing a rest over the festive oeriod,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
With the brothers together hopefully Sean will find better form.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Sean longstaff needs to be in the stands and learn from his brother how to actually play football,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"Hoping for another solid performance
Cmon lads",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
idk why he stick with joelinton would like to see Gayle play more a lot more pace up front then,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
"Ehhhhh no we are in serious trouble today, the defenders are in for a hard day ffs 20% possession today me thinks. Just when you think Bruce can't get any sillier he pulls this rabbit out the hat",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
They get the ball forward then goes all the way back. Shaun longstaff trotting around again too slow and joeLinton no words needed.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Replace Steve Bruce with someone like Anthony Pulis and it would look better.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Put schar in front a back 4 so we've got another body in midfield then drop back in when needed,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
See the chuckle brothers starting today what chance you got ü§îü§î Bruce is clueless,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1

"Sorry but i dont rate the longstaff brothers... yes good in our team, not in a team against top 5 in the league...",167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Can‚Äôt stand these sky commentators. Always so biased against Newcastle on any decision,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Nice team ... would have prefered an unchanged side as it would have given everyone a huge boost of confidence ... just dont get how and why Sean walks into the team based on his awful form and performances *sigh* .. i would also have Gayle instead of Joey because yes i am probs the only one who actually likes Dwight as he can score goals and him with Wilson together would be fantastic front 2.,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1
Boys can we fight for everything today.and forgiveness sake dont gift thegoals.we have just put away all the christmas stuff.ok,167,Newcastle,Leicester,Home,-1

"Hendrick and Shelvey? Two of the biggest passengers this season. Poor.

Nothing against, Darlow, but I would be curious to see how Dubravka fairs in goal... Darlow could be doing well with amazing saves, but would Dubravka be better at providing much needed instruction and direction to the defense?",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"3 at the back again, we're short of centre backs and this is his solution. The only reason this PE teacher still has a job is because he is a yes man and Ashley loves when his employees do as they're told. Sure Sunday league teams wouldnt touch him with a barge pole at this point.",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Very poor in last game so let‚Äôs just put out the same team apart from Fraser and Murphy how Shelvey still gets a game is beyond me and Hendricks isn‚Äôt even a championship player by what I have seen,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
A pretty pathetic line up clearly playing for a draw a point is no longer good enough at this stage we need a win we need three points! Burnley have overtaken us and Brighton are hot on our tail and they play Fulham should be playing 4-2-3-1 our best formation.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendricks on starting eleven. Is this real life? He must be very good at training since in games he is always bad. Dont know what brucey is watching.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Probably deploy hayden in defense and invite pressure from a good attacking side rather than going for the jugular there defence which has proved leaky time and time again.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"5 at the back, at home, against a newly promoted side. It pains me to say it but I‚Äôm pleased I haven‚Äôt got BT, and I certainly won‚Äôt be going out my way to find a live stream for it. Ridiculous.",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Wtf did he not watch the last game !!!! Leeds will rip us apart again,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Did Bruce even see the last game , Hendrick and Shelvey were absolutely diabolical. The bloke hasn‚Äôt got a clue proper cabbage ü•¨ heed !",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"I can't help but think back, Crystal Palace, Joelinton and Wilson up front, we won ,never tried again, Manquillo has played well this season,when he does he's dropped, Ritchie at left back reasonably successful, Bruce wants us relegated.",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"That's the worst team HE BRUCE could have picked.. what the f..k is HENDRICK in the team for he does absolutely nothing.. Carroll should be on instead of Lewis.. I was going to say I am shocked by this team selection But it's gone beyond a joke . He hasn't a clue. ‚öΩÔ∏èüç∫‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏èüç∫
.",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
You know. It‚Äôs fast getting to the stage when I look and think. It doesn‚Äôt matter which 11 he starts with. I have zero confidence in it. Disillusioned much,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Lewis again. Must be Bruce's love child. Can't pass or tackle, Shelves, needs to play and pass quicker. A heavy Leeds Win i think",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"I‚Äôve been a lot less critical of Bruce than most but he‚Äôs starting to scramble about... why ‚Äúdo it my way‚Äù and then give up on that two games later... Darlow has sold the first goals in the previous two games, great stand in for Dubravka but your number 1s fit again, bring him back in... Lewis is young and still got loads to learn, giving the ball away too much, take him out and let him watch the game evolve... massive steps backwards with this selection and we can‚Äôt go back very much more",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Ritchie over Lewis. Lewis‚Äôs confidence is absolutely rock bottom. Not exactly blessed in the middle of the park either with Hayden covering CB. üôà,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Again pack the defence hope we can fluke one on the break then defend the rest of the game. Leeds will be camped in our half shooting at every opportunity. Another defeat coming up question is by how many?,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
If that's the team I cant believe Lewis and Hendrick are in the team.thats like playing with 9 men.manquillo is on the bench and we have a winger at right back.even if he plays Murphy I would rather have Ritchie at left back instead of lewis.lewis is terrible. Surely Carroll instead,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Lessons learned from Villa, then",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Looks like 541 again. Should have back 4 Manquelo Schar Lascelles Lewis 4 Almiron Shelvey Hayden Richie 2 Wilson Gayle - I take it Max isn't fit enough for a full game yet,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Jason Knight such a strong team, when you can afford to keep a ¬£40m talent on the bench. Not many in the bottom half can say that!! ü§£ü§£",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Why shelvey and hendrick are in the team is beyond laughable. Both horrendous,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendrick?? Surely that's a typo. Lets go back to when we weren't doing it Bruce's way!,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Wrong in so many ways the team on the bench would beat the team picked,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"What has Gayle got to do to get a start, and don't get me started on how Hendrick's gets anywhere near the first team squad nevermind starting. Bruce has absolutely no clue what he's doing. ü§¨ü§¨",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
If St Maximin is fit play him if not 100% fit why on the bench? If we are loosing by time he comes on he won't change the game. Another poor selection come on Bruce just leave,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"How Hendrick starts over Matty is beyond me
Also against the most defensively weak team in terms of set pieces, and with a short defence, would be been smarter to play Ritchie/ Joelinton/ Carroll
What do you expect though, sit back and hold out for a 3-0 loss",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"I can name 5 - 6 that I think are championship players there. Prove me wrong lads, come on... no lazy play, 100% effort is needed!",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Oh that godly 5 at the back. Always works wonders. An our star signing in the midfield with Shelvey. What could possibly go wrong?

Future prediction but also very predicable, no one coming in and Bruce still here in a month üò¢",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Front 3 is okay but it‚Äôs the midfield that lets us down. No creativity , no ball winner. A draw would be a good result against an attacking Leeds side.
It can‚Äôt get any worse can it............",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Would have been better off putting 2 traffic cones in midfield rather than those 2.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendrick and shelvey the worst midfield partnership we‚Äôve ever had shelvey can‚Äôt run and Hendrick contributes nothing to the team.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
With this type of line up he‚Äôs asking for the fans to hate him ... he‚Äôs begging the club to sack him... he want out but he want the money to go with it,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Should have dropped hendrick put hayden into cm and started carroll or gayle,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
5 at the back? Think I‚Äôll offer my services to go paint the tyne bridge with my toothbrush.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendrick again man!! And shelvey is Playing terribly at the moment!! Start ASM. Take him off when he‚Äôs done. Get bloody Matty or Ritchie on. This is getting beyond a joke. Think I‚Äôll go and paint another wall! It‚Äôll be more exciting,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Cannot believe Shelvey and Hendricks are starting!!!!,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Gloves must be back on then,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
At least Jonjo will be nice and fresh after his casual walk around Villa Park on Saturday night.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
I think the 9 on the bench could beat the starting 11..,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendrick must have dirty pictures of Bruce or something to keep getting picked. That or he pays for Bruce's takeaway every night,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"How does hendrick start every game, he‚Äôs absolute dross",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Better team on the bench,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
3 points to Leeds already,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Why Ritchie always on the bench ffs,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Jeff Hendrick and Shelvey absolutely give up with these two in midfield more mobility in a paraplegic #bruceout,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"5 at the back? See the gloves are back on then, lasted long",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Absolutely terrible I could pick a better team than That,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendrick and shelvey start again why why why Leeds will run rings around them,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Absolutely no clue how to pass a ball up the pitch, just John smiths smack and hope someone gets it, what happened to pride for the fans, o wait I will have a stroll on the pitch and still get payed, sack the manager for letting this happen I say..",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Nice to see st maximin on the bench at least, hope he gets some game time as we desperately need him back to fully fit asap",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Hendrick? Where's Ritchie, to smash some crosses in...we shall wait with baited breath Steve, on the Excuses...",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"We are at home , not playing an away game. This is not a team to go out and win the game . We have 2 midfielders that will get overun in Shelvey and Hendrick. Lewis needs extra cover like Richie in front ,or better still leave him out as he is not strong enough on his own.
We should be playing 2 up front . Like Wilson ,Carroll . Or Wilson, Gayle.
This is going to be another embarrassing 3 points for Leeds with this set up.
How many more games have we the fans have to suffer before he Sacks Bruce. üò°ü§¨",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
How do Shelvey and his partner in slothness Hendrick keep getting picked ahead of Matt Longstaff????? Seriously man cabbage,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Lewis and hendrick will be hammered tonight! Ritchie and Matty should be in for them two! Even an unfit ASM would be better than most of that lot.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Right how does Hendricks get a single nod before Richie,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"The sooner shelvey gets injured and hendrick gone the better

Bruce is clearly a closet mackem",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
How can you play such a legless midfield against a team that only attribute is athleticismüòÇ,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Really starting Jamal Lewis after his horror show at Elland Road?

Well Done Bruce, Tactical genius again",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"He must want the sack on that selection. Shelvey and hendrick in the midfield. Hayden is wasted playing in a back 5. What a shower, Cabbage heed has done it again.",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

iting pressure and as it‚Äôs shown, it doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôd really love to see us in a 4-3-3, even though jonjo and hendrick have been poor you could have them stay back to help defence and then almiron Cam with fraiser and asm either side of wilson, negative tactics yet again, what the hell are you doing in ‚Äútraining‚Äù
you keep saying it‚Äôs a work in progress but we keep seeing the same approach in every match and every match it ends the same way, us losing.....love
how our fans have had NOTHING to cheer about whilst lockdown has been going on, football is more than likely some people‚Äôs only source of enjoyment and newcastle have provided no entertainment whatsoever, cheers üëå",197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Would have played Carroll up front again with Wilson fetched Ritchie in. Dropped hendrick and played saint maximin.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Has he put the gloves back on 5 at back,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Every game that goes by .... the more danger we are facing. We are the worst team in the league by a wide margin. Something has to change,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
More or less same team. Fraser and Murphy more likely to get forward if allowed to. Fear it‚Äôll not happen,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
I actually predicted 3 -1 before the start. Sorry family i think we are heading for relegation if nothing is done immediately. Good thing Steve Bruce is not a manager in South Africa because after 2 games he would of been fired. But after 11 games without a win still keeps his job,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"What has he picked here Lewis lascelles no chance cannot defend
Shelvey Hendricks no legs no idea
Sorry but dubravka should be in goal

5 at the back and 2 of them are midfielders absolute joke this club,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Hendrick always put in a shift for us regardless of the position he was asked to fill. What have you lot been doing to have this impact on a decent player ?,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
I‚Äôd fire Bruce and hire lampard now. The job he‚Äôs done with younger players at Detby and Chelsea last year is exactly what we need.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Can only see one outcome here. Defeat. Bruce Out !,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
We deserve to go down.... Bruce has to go before its too late,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
The problem with any line up we put in we don‚Äôt have the link between defence and attack our midfield is our weak spot I don‚Äôt know why where trying to get defence in on loan it‚Äôs stupid the midfield is our weak point they can‚Äôt link up with the attackers and that‚Äôs we‚Äôre we are going wrong I hope they try harder tonight because they need to,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
"Jamal Lewis not again !never will be a left back ,cant tackle ,lightweight , a big weakness once again on the left hand side.

Shelvey and Hendrick in the centre of the park against this Leeds team. Can't wait to watch them watch the game as it passes by them.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Ffs not hendrick and Shelvey again. Lost already with them 2 playing,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1
Still the defensive 5-4-1set up. Bruce is clueless. He hasn't got an attacking gene in his make up. Most tactically inept and boring manager in our history.,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

Carrol has been one of our better players the last few games. That young guy that came on in the cup did really well. He‚Äôs never had a sniff since! I‚Äôd rather play him that Hendrick! üòÇ,197,Newcastle,Leeds,Home,-1

#NUFC",218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
Can't complain after Everton game BUT please don't reert back to defending and giving up possession or it will be back to square one. Let Jones do the talking and tactics please. Also like Anderson being on bench he has talent skill and strength. Bring him and St Maxim on second half if need be. New lad will come into squad for next game as well.Decent bench pleased M Longstaff on it rather than his brother. Come on Toon.,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
"Expecting to see ASM around 65mins in.

Would be guessing theres still issues with his fitness.

Guessing we let fraser run them raggered, then allow ASM to come on if tight and be impact player.",218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
Lascelles falls over his own feet and looks awfully dodgy every time he‚Äôs on the ball. Clark is just a more calming presence back there. I wouldn‚Äôt even bring Lascelles back and make Shelvey the permanent Captain.,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1

Manager has no tactics. Schar can bring the ball out of defence. Almiron is playing well Hayden is doing his job as is Wilson form your tactics around them.,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
Apparently Bruce said Fraser was not feeling well lol and ASM was gunna start but never mind still ok with that üëçüèª,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
Fair play to Bruce not making any changes. Other than the injury of course. Let's see how this pans out. Hopefully not every player behind the ball constant defending. Let's see some attacking intent,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
Can't really grumble after Saturdays performance. Enforced change makes sense. Play the same way again I'll be happy.,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
Come on!!! Hopefully another 30mins for ASM and he be fit to start. Love to see Fraser ASM Almiron and Wilson start,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1

Good win tonight to cheer us all up.,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
As long as bruceless doesn‚Äôt get to decide anything we should be alright. Bruce out ASAP. HWTL.,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
Surely after 3 sub appearances Saint Maximin should be ready for a start?!,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
"Once saint max back to full fitness id like to see him in almirons position and drop almiron back to hendricks position.
almiron has the workrate to defend and dribbling to get us forward so offers more than hendrick.",218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
"Would like to see ASM, Miggy and Fraser as a 3 behind Wilson.",218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1
Would have put ASM instead of Fraser and Dubravka instead of Darlow.,218,Newcastle,Crystal Palace,Home,-1

"best thing about that team is the correct keeper for a change, Darlow has done really well but a couple of big errors cost goals and my hearts stops a little when he comes running out for a cross he just doesn‚Äôt back himself, given the injuries there‚Äôs not many i would change in that line up",257,Newcastle,Wolves,Home,0

"Maybe time for dubravka but the way Bruce has gone about dropping Darlow is a disgrace, if it wasn't for some of his performances this season we'd be well in the bottom 3",257,Newcastle,Wolves,Home,0
"Sorry like but Joelinton has done nothing to merit a starting position in the team, it is definitely the owner telling him he should startüí© I've got nothing against the fella but he is not a premier League playerüò¢ what other team would preserve or even give him a starting placeü§î",257,Newcastle,Wolves,Home,0

Thank God Dubravka is back.....will start picking up points now.Karl Darlow was our weakest link.And Joelinton is a far much better player than Carroll and Gayle.The weakest link remaining in the team is Krafth.Shelvey will win us games though he doesn't put up a shift at times.Lewis will get better.,257,Newcastle,Wolves,Home,0
How on earth is Jamaal Lewis still getting a game? Dummett should be playing left back as Lewis gives away too many goals by loosing his man and not being aware of what‚Äôs around him when he has to come inside,257,Newcastle,Wolves,Home,0

"Steve Bruce was a great player and probably a canny bloke, even allowing for that accent, but he is a terrible clueless manager who is draining the life out of the club, he needs to go now",257,Newcastle,Wolves,Home,0
Disgraceful to drop Darlow. Lewis and Kraft against Neto and Traore is very worrying. Bruce has decided to go with 10 men by playing Joelinton- the equivalent of the player who‚Äôs mums used to bring oranges at half time so he‚Äôd get a game (must be kebabs for Bruce),257,Newcastle,Wolves,Home,0
"Definitely sleepwalking to relegation...le

Krafth and Jamal Lewis are supposed to be an upgrade on Yedlin and Dummett. Once against Bruce has been mugged off and been robbed blind. Lewis is no where near worth the 15million we spent on him.,257,Newcastle,Wolves,Home,0
"What does shelvey have to do to be dropped? Does he have photos of Bruce cheating on his local kebab shop by buying from kebab master? Playing with 10 again. Dummet should be on. Rest, about the best we got to go with.",257,Newcastle,Wolves,Home,0

Jo doesn't offer a goal but offers a small contribution, Gayle offers ZERO.
One attack tonight sticks out, we broke with a 3 on 3, Fraser plays the ball to Gayle who not only slows the attack to walking pace but then plays a shocking safe pass back in to the midfield.
Gayle should of been gone maybe 2-3yrs ago.

I couldn‚Äôt help but just laugh at this line up. Bruce‚Äôs got RB‚Äôs & CB‚Äôs on the bench & plays a RW at RB (RWB?) & a RB at CB.

Bruce brings a CAM in on loan & is now benched.

Bruce has a LB on the bench so he plays a RM at LB & his other LB is playing CB.

And to top it off he thinks playing a CF with a goal rate of 1 in every 33 games will get the goals he needs.

---what for ???",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Wilson and Willock to make an impact off the bench (to replace ASM and Miggy maybe). See this as a big score game with leaky defences. But 3-2 to the Toon at FT. Just my 2 pennies.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
What‚Äôs willock done wrong to be put on the bench again? He‚Äôs a stand out performer for us.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1

"Would have had Carroll up top for the 1st hour then bring Wilson on not Joefuckinlinton
again FFS .. and willock instead of longstaff",318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Cannot believe we have people saying Wilson should start. These are the same fans who would be slating Bruce for starting him if he pulls up after 60 mins with a recurring muscle injury.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Interesting comments regarding who should be playing centre forward. Not a mention of West Ham's former centre forward Andy Carrol who would be busting a gut to play against his old team.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1
Right team choice. Hope we grab some belief as west ham are shaky at the back. I can see us winning this one today but we need to watch out for their counter attack as they break so fast from the back.,318,Newcastle,West Ham,Home,1

I cba 1 distinguished centerhalf rest fullbacks or wing backs in a 5 man....this doesn't look good. Clark should be starting we need real cb not make shift ones. Goodluck boys your gunna need it. HWTL,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Going to be a long night playing whole team within 30 yards of our own keeper.,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
"Dont care bout result, sure we will lose. Maybe I wont watch the game. Hopefully six points against Sheff U & Fulham. Then all will be happy and next season will be the same..",357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1

"Hope we play the same way as we did against Leicester, but I have a feeling playing a RB at RCB is going to expose us... Would have taken Gayle over Joe for the threat in behind also",357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Rumours Man City are doing a guard of honour for Paul Dummetts bullet header,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
"Willock, 2-1, 200/1 on sky bet, oh go on I‚Äôll waste a fiver",357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
"Some of the comments on this about Carroll and Gayle over Joelinton !! Really, Carroll can‚Äôt run the channels and Gayle isn‚Äôt interested in doing that, yes Joelinton as a goal scorer isn‚Äôt going to happen but one thing he offers is a willingness to run the channels to drag people out of position and hopefully free up space for Maxi and Miggy !!",357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
"No one expects NUFC to beat Man City, would rather lose 5-0 and have ago at them rather than sitting back for 90 minutes, not creating anything and losing 5-0. We have put 9 goals in against 3 of the top 6 lately, granted no Wilson but still, at least have a go! Nothing to lose tonight",357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Ref should have a blue shirt on no bookings for city haway man,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1

Man City have offered you to win this game so utilize the chance. They have rested 60% of their key players.,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Carroll for slowinton and please take that captains armband off our most least enthusiastic player that shouldn't even have the shirt let alone the armband,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Got to have a go tonight like it makes no difference we are safe,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Come on lads shock the world and let‚Äôs have a win,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Why hasn‚Äôt he given the kids a chance ffs,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
"Was really hoping we would see Anderson, matty and Carroll! Why not?",357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Like to have seen Gayle get the start. Activate his contract extension with no intention of ever playing him,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
"With the manager getting a recent lift re his 'award,' I am now expecting his tactical nous to overcome any concerns that I feared over potential Joelinton selection.... NOT.",357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
"Hope for the same as last week but slightly worried Bruce will sit back for no reason. Either way, support your club no matter what.",357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
"Not playing with a striker then, put Carroll up front and get crosses in the box",357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Just keep Hendrick off the pitch.,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
What the hell is the cabbage head doing putting the Brazil nut in the starting line up.,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
What did folk expect? Good job that agent Bruce is a top manager again isn't it? I'm sure that the pundits will lap it up though.,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
safe from relagation and joelinton still get nod. why not let Carrol or Gayle have a game it could be there last few games for us. no doubt joelinton will be stuck with us next season,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Would've preferred Gillespie up front instead of Joelinton ü§£,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Scott Carson playing in goal for them not played in the Premier league since 2011 should put him under pressure straight away although I know in reality he will have nothing to do and we will get pumped 4/5 nil,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Least willocks starting up the toon shame about Wilson but come on lads a result here would be a decent result hwtl !!!!!,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1
Let's just have a go today don't stick 10 behind the ball we've got nothing to lose,357,Newcastle,Man City,Home,-1

"Thought maybe a couple of the youngsters could‚Äôve at least been put on the bench. They may have got a short run out if we were sat comfortably. Then again... we are VERY rarely comfortable

Other than that, looks a good team",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"Just goes to show how far away the younger players must be if not one of them are included in the squad to play in what is effectively a dead rubber.
Or is it just a short sighted view of getting an extra million or 2 for finishing a couple of places higher?
Either way it wreaks of ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt have a long term strategy apart from staying up‚Äô",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
Great team but would rather Gayle over joelinton or put them together,367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"For all the talk of the youngsters and are so called decent academy, shame 3:4 don‚Äôt get the bench with a potential chance to shine and Jeff Hendricks does??? Awful",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
Surely Anderson should be getting some time in the squad at least. No better time for him to get game time than against bottom of the league when we're already safe.,367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"Short sighted not to have a couple of young guys on the bench, at least. We are safe and therefore have nothing to lose so if we could throw a young player or two on with 20 minutes to go in a winnable game it would have been beneficial to them",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1
"Love how you some of us are still slagging Joelinton off - he‚Äôs got 3 in his last 5 starts. Yes, his overall record is poor. I‚Äôm not saying his recent form deserves any praise in the grand scheme of things but honestly some of the bashing on here is ridiculous üôÑü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1

"honestly, it took me sometime to believe when I read the first half statistics. something like 12 shoots, 66% procession, 200+ passes. Maybe 8 to 10 matches ago, all I asked was a proper football match from Newcastle. Not survival, not dominant performance but simply a proper football game with defence and attack, passing and dribbling, anything with basic football skills and teamworks. It was really bad, and it makes the recent display unbelievable. I knew, by watching these two teams over two seasons, things can go from bad to worst out of the blue. But lets hope for the better with the spirits inside these bunch of players.",367,Newcastle,Sheffield Utd,Home,1

I would have rested a few more Bruno, Maguire, Rashford etc as I‚Äôm sure we can win this game with a weakened team.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"You could see the quality in the lineup but would they turn up and deliver?

The blades are basement club this season and have been generously terrible.

Playing at home and wounded might just be what it takes to get them going again.

"The midfield of 2 sloppy but technical players. Its going to be a disaster for our defence. Not sure they should be starting together, paul and matic in the same midfield",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Again, terrible way to show a line up. Is it in number order? Is it in order of what position they play? No it's neither. Please list team line ups in position format:
Goalkeeper
Defenders
Midfielders
Strikers
Substitutes.
A little bit of artistic licence alowed dependant on assumed formation.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Too much in attack in this line up it is good but would rather have Fred or Scott in the team one of the 2.. But let's hope for the best,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1

Great attacking lineup. Let's go out and score a handful!,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Are Tuanzebe and Bailly injured? With all the games coming up you would think there would be a bit more rotation for this game. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Matic, Telles and Pogba starting ain't good for that midfield and left back.
Telles is a liability defensively, Matic is slow, Pogba is a liability defensively too, should never be in our 18 yard cos it's a penalty. This man Ole never learns.
If you must play Pogba, play Fred too or Scott.

Why tinkering so much",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Please let Van De Beek leave in January!!!
There is no player in the squad that deserves to start as much as he does.
Waste of talent to let him sit on the bench everytime. üò°",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"‚≠ï I wish Juan Mata was utilized more often. His performances on the pitch have mostly been electric! Especially with Bruno.

Please play Sergio Romero soon. Or loan him out to a good club. He's a talented player still. I miss watching him play. One of my favourite goalkeepers of all time.

#MUFC",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"More changes. üòíEvery time a window of opportunity opens up - second place if we win our games in hand - we make a hash of it. Let‚Äôs get this done tonight, boys.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Except for Henderson and Telles, this was the team that got us into 3rd last season.

I just hope the players turn up. Keep the shape, outrun the other team and play our game.

"I just feel sorry for Dean, he'll play well and Ole will continue benching him again.

As for Ole's neighbour's friend's son, Martial, am just puzzled why he keeps leading the line.

Looking forward to #Brugba in that midfield!

I can't guarantee winning for this sloppy may Utd. They dissapoint when the expectations of fans are highest on them.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Let‚Äôs hope we don‚Äôt make Sheffield United look like Barcelona !,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"It's amazing. If you're going against city and top teams, have luke shaw, Fred and Mctomnay.

If you're playing against defensive sides Matic, Pogba, Telles for creativity....

Ole is a genius",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Now everyone is happy with the team selection and formation. When we lose (which we won't) no nagging about why didn't he use Shaw or Donny van de beek etc. Get behind your team as a fan and be supportive,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Either Fred or Scott would have been better alongside Bruno and Pogba.....my thought though....but not Matic.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Great lineup though Matic ahead of Fred is surprising,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Listen. Mason Greenwood is not going to work as a winger if you're planning to play wide. Greenwood is a more narrow field player. Also. Where is Donny? Fred and Mctominay has been rested and still no space for Donny? Wtf man.

Why barely any attacking options on the bench? 4 midfielders, 2 defenders and the athlete, James?

Anyways I see nothing else other than a win.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"I‚Äôd prefer to have Romero in the starting lineup, but Henderson will suffice.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"This season big teams dropping points so easily, if we couldn‚Äôt be title contenders so it would be massively disappointing.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Why is a player that doesn't want to be here playing over Donny van de Beek.
Why have we spent 40m on a player to sit on the bench? Absolutely ludicrous",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Fred must and should always Start!!
Nemanja matic can't defend. He is too slow.
Won't be surprised if we lose. Ole should have at least used mctominay",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
OMG the iconic front three is back ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1

"Att:Mr Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r please
don't bottle the two games in hand
You have done so several occasions
From the
F.A semi final against Chelsea(July 2020) to Champions League exit(December 2020)
Simple games but we undermined opponents.Poor selections and unwise subs costed us!

If you want us to challenge the title of which we're so much capable ,take these two games vs Sheffield and Leeds with seriousness as Manchester United used to do.
Just Field strong team,wake up from the Coach's seat stand in the touchline, boost players morale make wise timely subs and the rest is history.
If we win next two games we shall be in a position to chase the leaders

Good line up but Fred or van de beek for matic could have been better.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
3 point and a clean sheets.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Would have loved to see one of the CB getting a rest. I‚Äôm a bit skeptical about the slow midfield combination of pogba and Matic. But good luck to Ole and the boys,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
What was the point of us signing Van De Beek just to start Nemanja Matic,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Fred instead Matic and the lineup is good,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Not going to say guaranteed win because I know man united but good line up but why is Fred maybe we need his energy for the Leeds game let's get these 3 points tonight don't let us down,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
At least with henderson cleansheet is a guarantee,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
FIFA is a joke ... just like Var and Manchester United,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Good lineup eventho i think Fred should start instead Matic. But nvm, all the best ManU! Please dont be the 1st team to LOSE to Sheffield! üòÇ",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
This is a great line up! Victory is assured! Three points on the road into the bag. Win the match guys. Good luck! GGMU!,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
That's an attacking starting 11. Let's win this match well so we can rest a few key players for the weekend in the second half.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
They're running a 5-3-2 so we won't be lighting up their goal often.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"I get that it might be tactical or team needs rotating but this is the problem with Ole, Mctominay was one of our best players against City and he's taken out of the starting 11 again and it happens almost every game with the team, players can't find any consistency.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
My heart hurts for Van De Beek. If there was ever a game to let him and Bruno do their thing together to prove it works,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Delighted to see Henderson in goal. Would like to see van de beek playing, hopefully we will win but our results are unpredictable",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Looks like a very SLOW midfield to me, we really need to get the ball forward Quicker, would have Mata instead of Martial, 2 up top is enough, should still win, Sheffield are woeful",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
How come I turn on the tv and United are losing 4 minutes in again. I swear the players do it on purpose every time they could climb the table. They are becoming depressing,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Hurrible slow start from our lads...That is a weak point for our team. This is a game to get 3 points and more goals advantage to us...And we are messing things up already putting pressure on themselves.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
I sincerely hope Sheffield United doesn't win their first game through us. Let's not under rate them the way we did Huddersfield some seasons ago!,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Wishing you guys a 3 point and score as many goals as possible any chance you get do a finish. The line up is a win don't let's us down. Come on Reds we got this,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"How much longer have we got to put up with Ole going with Martial, this season he has done nothing whatsoever for our team, give him away in January",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1

Decent line up but it's all about the performance...,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
This should be a winnable game for Man U but I won't be surprised if they fail to win because this is the type of game they normally end up drawing or even loosing.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Are you taking something which is not legal again we have gone behind he gets a average result against a decent team and everybody is blowing his trumpet like he is the best thing since sliced bread and then we play a team where everybody is 3 points easily and we then loose if we do win this it then keeps him in a job he shouldn‚Äôt be in,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
No Fred from the starting lineup he should have started tonight match because he makes things more easier for the team.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Why does he keep picking Martial??,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1

"Except Henderson , this was the team that got beaten by spurs 6-1.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
So they‚Äôve pretty much forgotten about Brandon Williams. He was a nice exciting change of pace at left back,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Not wise to put Bruno for midfield he is not going to shine any way glory glory Manchester United üî•üî•üî¥üî¥ keep the fire burning I see a come back,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
This formation and line up took us to 3rd place last season I pray it wins us the league this time,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
See how the game early and rest players in the second half is the plan... I hope. Win this game on the first half,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"We are the most useless team in the Prem at playing the ball out of our own end, yet we keep on attempting to do it FFS...probably 90% of opposition chances are created from our own inability",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Though I would have loved Fred ahead of Matic, still, Nice tweak Ole! The first time this man is going full attack!",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Ole has always failed us, why do you start Fred and mctomny on bench on such important game, a game that we need to take advantage by improving on the table position????",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Why always Martial?? And Pogba starting because of one good game??? I won't be surprised if Shieffield starts their winning with United tonight...You are ill-treating Ighalo Ole... Keeping Fred out in a crucial game like this... This man is really confused,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Could literally play the class of 92 and still win tonight anyway.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
How does van deal beek never get a start? Might as well sell on in January. Talent wasted .,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
This guy going to show his talent tonight! üòÅ,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
It‚Äôs Sheffield only. Let‚Äôs check for any surprises as always. Fun of watching Manchester United~,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"With Pogba and Matic as a midfield, if we win the match, we are lucky.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Those who are saying it is the wrong line up. The line up is right. Sheff plays 5 at the back. So we need creative midfielders. Shaw might come on later if we score first. Also, Pogba is right choice over VDB cz Pogba is used to play deep at United and can create chances from there. There was no chance VDB could start this game against compact Sheffield United. I can see James most probably coming on later in second half later. Fred, Mc Tominay and De Gea are being rested cz there are matches every 3 days.
Get behind your manager instead of criticizing him and saying we might draw or loose. Sheffield is not an easy draw. Support the decisions of the manager. He is not doing bad. He is not of the level of Pep or Mou, but he is doing good.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
With this line up automatically we are winning this game straight three points is our counting on you guys,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Theres a bigger game for fred at the weekend so i get matic. Srong team, should be a strong 3 pts #GGMU",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1

"Already one goal down though it is too early to concede a goal,let us see the reaction from the players since we are the Kings of come back",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
We are dark horses for the title but win our 2 games in hand and we go 2nd ü§î but apparently we are having a crap season ...,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Pogba Matic has never worked all season.... Both of them very slow at recovery.... I see much pressure on our defence today...,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
I prefer Fred instead of Matic but all the same good line up 3 points at stake.,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Changes again, to disrupt the team. If we don‚Äôt get 3 points tonight, and it won‚Äôt be easy, then there is no hope ! Not sure Ole is THE man !",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
This team keeps making people's stress levels higher week in week out. U can't take advantage Spurs beaten Chelsea beaten Leicester beaten,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Is Van De Beek injured !!!! Why on earth did we buy him,!! Obviously Ollie doesn't like him to pick matic instead beggars belief FFS",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Would be alot easier on the brain to take in if they just did it in position order like they used to and not numbers,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
I think my concern is Matic and Martial missing chances instead of converting them to goals.GGMU!!! Come on boys let's get the 3point,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Ole is now a little flexible with his players selection, can't wait to see when he makes a change at the heart of defense",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Fortunately tonight is against Sheffield, but a midfield with Pogba and Matic together in the line up is like playing 9 vs 11.

Do you remember who were in midfield against Tottenham in the 6-1??

They are always jogging, walking, lazy, out of their position, always late to defend and recover the ball and makes the team completely fragile",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Probably our strongest lineup on paper. Possibly Cavani in for martial but that‚Äôs it,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Hendo and Harry will be welcomed back as heroes, two tremendous players for one of the best teams in the world. It‚Äôs going to be a tough game",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"VAN DE BEEK needs to be starting!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!! What‚Äôs the point in paying the price tag he did for a player if he‚Äôs spent more time in the bench then he has the pitch. üôà Sheffield united haven‚Äôt won a game yet.. UNTIL TONIGHT I bet!",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Today we lose the match against Shelfield,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Ole is really underestimating
this Sheffield team ..
That midfield is a disaster..
Just hope we don't lose the match ..",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
Swap Matic for Fred and the lineup is perfect! Let go!,126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"With this silly set up üò¢üò¢üò¢. When will this insect realize how important these games are??? Scott was practically the best player in the last game and now he is on the bench. And Fred üòßwhoever gave Ole this job, If there's God, let him judge you.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Hi, Dean Henderson ""What were you thinking to lose the first goal of this game?"" I hope you won't do again on the next matching time if you're lineup. Please drill hard after trained on everyday.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"What happened about my 2players Jesse lingard and macos rojo for now I,will change my team üòè",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"But do we buy players and not use them, this players are fatigued.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Wow... Henderson? I can't recall a game Romero played in the prem that De Gea wasn't injured. Congrats to him anyway. I feel bad for Romero though, I hope he gets playing time elsewhere.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
"Numerical listings look even shitter when your goalkeeper isn't no.1
Maybe if the office staff were consistent, the team would be.",126,Sheffield Utd,Man Utd,Away,-1
I am speechless looking at this line up. Why Carroll is not starting alongside Wilson just amazes me. And before anyone says he cannot play 2 games in a row. If he is fit to be on bench then he is fit to start and we could hit them from the off.,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Nine defensive minded players against a team that haven‚Äôt won a league game in nearly a year. There may be Bruce fans in here but that lineup is disgusting. Football is a results business but the fact of the matter is it‚Äôs a struggle to even care about the results when the standard of football is as toxic as it is. Fans are fans because they love the game, but it becomes a real challenge when they don‚Äôt even play it",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"A back five against a team who haven't won a league game yet... Jesus wept, this should be a spectacle and half.",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
At least Joelinton isn't in but I fail to see what Hendrick contributes,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Swear Bruce puts Longstaff in the team as a middle finger to Newcastle fans,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Five at the back what a disgrace we should be attacking teams like this instead of defending against them I fear a defeat tonight and getting sucked into a relegation battle,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Sean Longstaff man... he needs a little break from the team. He‚Äôs worked so hard for the team and I think he looks tired these days! Just an observation!,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"If the fans were in Bruce wouldn‚Äôt be in a job FACT,
Absolutely clueless,
We can‚Äôt defend so why not have a go
Good times a long long way off,",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Dreadful ghastly team, total shambles.

A back five when we are playing a team bottom of the league.

Players out of position, playing the same dross players who have done nothing all season. The bloke is actually clueless.

No passion, no hunger and no attacking power. Parking the bus against the worst time in the league sums up Bruceüò°

Can‚Äôt even see a defender on the benchüò≥",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Again not impressed with team selection, our midfield is so poor. Imo I'd like Murphy be playing, but at least Joelinton won't be stinking the game out. Still reckon Bruce will bring the knacker on though, although I hope not. We should be playing 2 strikers against these.",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
We haven‚Äôt got the players. But Bruce is too negative. We can only score from set pieces.,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Five at the back and one up front against a team that hasn‚Äôt won a League game all season. Bruce is a tactical dinosaur üôÑ,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Why not go all out and get some goals? Five at the back against a side that can't score!! May have well started Carroll up front with Wilson. I give up I really do,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Sorry like but this is the straw that broke the camel's back. We r playing the worst team in the league who havnt won a single PL game and we go 5 at the back and even stick a couple of defensive midfielders in just to be sure. I can understand if Carroll knackered but what does Gayle have to do to get a start. Hope we win but it won't be because Bruce has orchestrated a great game strategy. Time to go, Bruce out !!!!",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Shocking lineup 5 at the back against bottom of the league #bruceout,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
He‚Äôs pretty much playing 4 centre half dummett isn‚Äôt a wing back this has to be worst team he‚Äôs picked and he‚Äôs picked some shocking teams should have played Carroll from the start if you get an hour out of him then fine he was our best player on Saturday by a mile. If we lose this it‚Äôs ok Bruce‚Äôs head and he has to go.,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"5 at the back against a team who haven't won all season, absolutely gutless. I actually hope we don't get a result tonight and he's gone!",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Murphy needs to start games. When he has come on he makes an impact and looks like our best chance of creating a goal, but when he comes on its too late in the game.",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"The opponent has two points all season. We‚Äôre playing five at the back hoping to hold on to a 0-0, with Dummett - who has never crossed a half way line in his life - as a WINGback?

Depressing.",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Also, I hope fraser has shown a lot in training to deserve a start, given his injury record over the last 10 month, yes I know he's been training past 10 days, I'd rather see him eased in",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"I know matty gets plenty praise and rightly so, but is he the answer? Other CMs seem to lack pace in our team but I noticed last game he played how much he struggled to get back. Honestly much rather see Ritchie in the middle even though it's not his position",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Hendrick and S Longstaff are too slow as a pairing. Wow.

Neither close down the opposition. They hardly ever press.

Doesn't look good at all",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
5 at the back against a struggling teamüòÇüòÇ,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Sheffield United haven't won all season and have just 2 points, up steps Newcastle United... 5 at the back against a team struggling so muchü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Glad to see useless joelinton isn‚Äôt playing üëç but defo agree with everyone on here 5 at the back?! Play more offensive and go and win against a team who haven‚Äôt won all season! Give the team the confidence they need!!!!,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
He's gotta go. If it's 5 at the back at least have attacking wing backs. I'm pretty sure we can contain them with 4 but we've zero creativity further up. This is the worst selection he could of gone with.,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
I can see Derby again where Newcastle were the only team they beat! It‚Äôll be the same thing with Sheffield,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Matty longstaff has been one of our best players since his return to the team, why on earth his brother gets picked ahead of him I'll never know, and how Jeff hendrick gets anywhere near that team is beyond me",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
When Sheffield had lost something like 9 games I looked at their fixtures and said a while back that they would get there first win against Newcastle.. it reminds me of when Derby only won 1 game all season and it was against us ü§£,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
5 at the back and 1 up front against bottom of the league a team who haven‚Äôt won a league match in 6 months. No thank you. Think al watch Come Dine with Me on catch up,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"5 at the back against a team yet to win a game of football and look at the state of that midfield (Hayden aside)... Absolutely no creativity, no excitement, just nothing - a nothing team playing in a nothing game. At any other club the manager would be under severe pressure if he doesn't win today... But this is Ashley's NUFC",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
What kind of team is that the bench is better 5 at the back against bottom of the league . It‚Äôs depressing,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
absolutely shocking why such a negative formation should have at least 2 up front can see us losing this,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
I'm 34 years old and I've never found it so difficult to figure out who is playing in what positions and what formation we're playing. I'm convinced Steve Bruce is doing it on purpose now,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
One up top and five at the back against one of the worst teams in PL history at this stage in the season. Could only be Steve Bruce.,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"BRUCE OUT , Won 2 out of 23 games when playing 5 at the back. What a pisstake he really is, even if we get a result tonight enough is enough. Cue the players were fatigued from 120 mins in the cup.",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Wondering why carroll and almiron aren't starting. Assumed were brought off against arsenal to give them a rest for tonight,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
5 at the back agains a team who literally haven't won a game this season. You love to see it.,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1

Why are we defensive against bottom of league team that has 2 points,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"So many defenders by the clueless joke we have in the bench.

What does Murphy have to do to play in the first 11? Anderdon was excellent too, deserves a chance.",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
5 at the back against team not won a game ffs,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
We‚Äôre playing Sheffield United who haven‚Äôt won a game all season and we go 5 at the back with 3 defensive midfielders. How can we be so negative.,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Playing bottom of league and play a defensive selection and formation..#bruceout,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Is anyone else looking at the bench thinking the bench is a better team than what wev got on the pitch?,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"I said from day one I wouldn‚Äôt support him as our manager.

Hes ridden the coat tails of a really good manager and his set up.

The fact that he appeared to look competent for a time is surely testament to the regime Rafa had in place?

Win or lose SB has to go. Playing a formation like this against the worst team in the league is disgraceful. Taxi for Bruce!,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Can anyone explain how we can play with 11 in our own half yet there still to be THIS MUCH space available??? So frustrating these tactics and worse against a team with worst start EVER to Premier League season üò°,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1

Would of went 433 against these carol gayle and wilson up top. Bruce out.,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Apart from Hendrick I like the team as Rafa said schar likes to go forward so dummett can drop back but then again we only have Fraser that can cross it and Wilson doesn‚Äôt have anyone supporting him,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Well let‚Äôs just take a guess at what the hells gonna happen eh. The way we‚Äôve been playing we need the starting 11 and all the subs ü§£ but it would be nice if we could see the Wilson/Fraser duo actually do what they apparently do best together. Still not impressed with Sean. Almiron or Ritchie would of been a better pick to me personally. Glad to see he didn‚Äôt drop Darlow though,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Looks like same mistake with Fraser as with asm. He is gonna be too central. Dummet offers solidity on a flank in a 4, not sure he should play in a 5 like. At least longstaff looks like he will get to play a bit further up the pitch rather than sitting as he is wasted there.",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
One striker against Sheffield United just sums up Steve Bruce and his management capabilities. Non existent. Now how‚Äôs the bacon did you say?,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1

Hendrick and longstaff bring absolutely nothing to the team there championship players at there best...another defeat tonight with 20% possession,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
That team sums up Bruce's managing skills.. üòë,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
-Normally I‚Äôd Argue That 5 At The Back Isn‚Äôt Necessarily *More* Defensive From A Tactical Perspective But We Have A Manager That Mostly Plays Defensive...So There‚Äôs That üôÑ,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"That is a shocking line up against Sheffield U. Where is the midfield creativity, S Longstaff has been utter pap every time I have seen him this season, big Andy was great against Arsenal & now gets dropped & 5 at the back (including Dummett who with the exception of Wayne Fereday is the worst player I have ever seen in black & white). Taxi for Cabbage Heed !",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"Shameful, negative, horrendous , boring and embarrassing.
We're playing a team that's lost all but 2 games this season. And haven't won a game.
They've torn us to bits. I undertake tactics against the top 6 teams. But this is Sheffield bloody Uni for crying out loud.
The worst and most damning thing is. Having Fraser sent off won't make us play any worse. Because its not possible",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"5 at the back against a winless team, and 3 poor Central midfielders, beggars belief, let's hope frazier finds Wilson a couple of times",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1

He plays 5 at the back every game then u wonder why we don't score much goals. We are playing against a team that haven't won a game madness and not good to watch,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Bruce says it was an awful decision to have to pick between his keepers. Presumably he wanted to play them both the negative git!,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Some strange choices at least joelinton isn't playing but very negative against bottom team,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"5 at the back with Hayden sitting in front of them , no creative midfielder. What's that about !!",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"6 defenders plus longstaff and hendrix, might still pinch the points but going to be horrible to watch, what is bruce doing ü§¨",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"I know we played 120 minutes on Saturday evening, but this is the most negative team you could put out. Everyone apart from Wilson and Fraser isn‚Äôt going to be doing any attacking. I‚Äôd rather lose and go out and try then to lose and play defensive football and not defend",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"The guy has not got a clue 5 at the back against a team who cant score , should be attacking teams like this , Steve Bruce has to go . Playing for a draw against bottom of the league should be 2 up top and going for it . Matty and Hayden in the middle Miggy should of been in aswell with Carroll up top with Wilson. Go now Steve before you take us down.",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1

Bruce will make SHU looks like top 4 teams üòÑ...on the bench u hv attacking players but still playing 5 at the back...might as well play dubravka as ctr back,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"This team selection is absolutely ridiculous, should be attacking a team with Sheffield‚Äôs record. Couldn‚Äôt believe he is playing 5 at the back.
Bruce must only have one way of playing, no plan B.
Got to go if we get beat tonight!!",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
5 at the back against bottom of the table? He‚Äôs a man scared of losing- even when we should be confident going into games like this...,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"5 at the back is fine if you have attacking wing backs that turn it into a 3 when you have the ball. Dummett won‚Äôt be up and down the line and Yedlin will try and ultimately fail. Longstaff and Hendrick offer zero in the middle of the park. Fraser yet to really get going, will be unfit more than he is fit this season.

Hayden, Wilson, Clark, Darlow, Schar, Fernandez only ones who merit being on the pitch.",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"WTF!!! What the hell is this team!!!

Sheffield bottom of the league we should be going all out attacking

U watch we will be the first team they beat this season

Bruce is clueless dinosaur ü¶ñ",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"This team selection is craven, cowardly and beyond parody.
We are playing side which has 2points from 17 games and we are frightened to attack. We are sitting back and hoping to hit them on the break.

We had a full attacking bench and he went super cautious and played scared. Bye bye Bruce I feel I could do better with my fifa experience ü§£,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Typical start by Newcastle very little possession and nots shots on goal,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"If we lose this game, I'll never watch them again under this hierarchy. We're making Sheffield United look like champions.",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
Shocking team selection !!! No creativity in the midfield too slow and defensive.,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
"We rarely struggle against the blades. Shelvey and Saint maximin got us a win away last season then after lockdown we won and maximin was a standout player. The thing is, we shouldn‚Äôt struggle against them and usually we win. But it doesn‚Äôt look like our starting side has much in the way of attack. Sheffield United (a few miles from my house) struggle for goals, have no wins but are at almost full strength. They‚Äôll be right up for this.

What concerns me is playing our players out of position because of our lack of depth. Covid hit us. Maximin isn‚Äôt playing. Our attack will be from Callum Wilson. That‚Äôs pretty much all. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we brought Carroll etc on.

Carroll was unlucky not to score against arsenal but it was worrying to see the only player who came close to scoring was one that‚Äôs only got one goal in two years.

Glad to see joelinton out. Ritchie is out and that‚Äôs good. Almiron plays well at times but needed benching. Fernandez and Schar like against Liverpool are very strong. But, regardless as to who we play in our starting eleven, the tactics are a big worry from Steve Bruce. Are we playing to grind out a dull draw? Or are we rotating to show Ashley we need players?

We should be going at teams like this and scoring goals. I can see a scrappy game and if Sheffield United score we will find it very tough with what we have fielded to salvage owt.

We have to add. I don‚Äôt mean players from Chelsea b team or from the hills of Africa. We need quality. Clear we won‚Äôt spend money but once again all paper talk no action.

Sorry lads, as confident as I am normally against Sheffield United can you imagine how embarrassing this is going to be if we don‚Äôt win. Not convinced Fraser will do that much either.

Good luck lads",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
If we lose tonight brucey needs to pack his bags and walk.,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1
We are being over run by the team at the bottom please bring some of the youngsters in as they will be in the team when we go down might as well get to know them,176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1

"There for the taking.

Steve Bruce before the match.

Okay lads, they are obviously a weakened team, but remember what happened at Brentford, they will be up for it, Park the bus, don't let them score.

After the match:

We gave them a good run for the money but they were too strong for us and obviously more motivated because it was their first win of the season.

"Right playing 5 at the back isn't necessarily a defensive move... You can attack a lot with a solid base of 3CBs and pushing both fullbacks forward and having CMs making runs into the box and ahead of the strikers... So lets give it a chance at least, I seriously doubt we will see a fantastic attacking performance, but lets not write the setup off before they've even stepped out onto the pitch",176,Sheffield Utd,Newcastle,Away,1

"This is good playing XI we have in my opinion.. Greenwood ahead of an off color Martial or Cavani is good. Also good to see De Beek in starting XI to combine with Fernandes...

What the hell willian is doing in the team. I think he is adopted son of arteta. He outcast ozil because of him and see the results = poor performance from willian,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Why can't Arteta play a midfield trio of Partey, Elneny and Niles ? Williams is passe and Xhaka has no creative bent to his game, unless you like backpasses and lateral ball movement. Arteta, just remember that you are the architect of your own failure or success !",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"I just came from the future to express my anger towards Xhaka who foolishly lost posession, thrice, allowing Son to score a hat-trick!",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
I‚Äôd rather have seen Elneny replace Xhaka and Willock in for Willian. But I feel strangely good about this Derby day!,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Xhaka is not forward thinking and always plays backwards and side ways..
unless Thomas is gonna play ahead but this will leave the back exposed coz xhaka can still cover the back line",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Mesut √ñzil since joining Arsenal
254 games
44 goals
77 assists

No player in the premier league has done that
We need a bit of experience in the pitch
#BringOzilBack",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Lose this game arteta needs to go as will be 6 defeats in 11 games we are 15th in league looking like relegation as why does willian keep getting games he has done nothing for us not looking forward to this at all could be a hammering for us here,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Willian again. Eish. I hope Partey is fit if he isn't 100% fit then this will not be helpful to us. A draw will be a good result for us given how horrible we have been playing. A win will be a welcome bonus. I hope we playing 4-2-3-1 with this team.,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
This team is going for relagation if ozil was there the resaults could have been differrent it needs experienced players not young boys like these.We need an experienced coach,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Not a convincing line up, experience wise it's a tick but technical wise no.",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"The rain hasn't stopped yet, we are in for a beating, not only this game but many games to come, Arteta seams to have lost the dressing room love with many of his players, the end result he is taking us near the relegation zone. It's painful to watch his premier league games. So sad. The best we can get today is a goal we are done,why lie, 3-0,3-1 0r 4-1 or even 4-0 etc",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"What is Willian, and Xhaka doing there
? El neny was perfect for this game, he is a hardworker, he compliment Partey very well. XHAKA cannot do the basics of football, just passing and tackling, he can't even run or track people,, Arteta is losing my trust",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Partey is quarter fit but he's better than Xhaka and Ceballos combined even when he's not fit enough..But I prefer he should have been rested since we need him in more games to come...Even so he should have been paired with Elneny.. Partey/
Elneny should be the metronome in that midfield..Xhaka is Soo useless with his back passing
Anyway we might win this",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
The good old derby the lineup looks okay let‚Äôs take this game by storm .its upto the lads to perform well today If the lads can just create that positive energy in the team today we are likely to take away the three points.good luck hope we win this match and put a smile on my face once again. #COYG,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Good line-up, except Holding. He should be replace by Pablo Mari. I believe William can perform today due to opponent's defence have Laca & Auba to guard. Xhaka do can perform mainly due to Partey beside him and he has less defensive duty tonight.",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Willian is never supposed to start any football match in his career again.,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
A BIG IF we get a draw against Jose it will be a great result but I can't see Laca scoring on this one,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"At the end of the match, it will be ""this is not the result we wanted""",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"What is the contract agreement between Arteta and Willian? This Willian guy does not deserve any place in an Arsenal team; not even on the bench.

He is the weakest link in this team",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Try to escape under pressure with our great efforts.Make us proud.Never give up.Fighting.
The team need to show a real test of our mettle.Show a special team work .Coyg",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"There we go again, the bus formation.... The entire middle field with defenders... Laca and Auba will probably not score because there is no one to create chances for them and the next thing we complain that they are out of form.. Come on",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Strong team. We need to hit them fast and hard. If they given time and space we will be in trouble. We‚Äôve got more to lose than them so do what lower teams do to us now and don‚Äôt respect the opponent.,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Arteta is predictable...T
oo defensive midfiledü§îü§î..still no creativity in the squard..Mou will hav an easy game to win.. Safe the message and remind me later...",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"The way we are playing it seems that Emery was better than Arteta, we never lost under him.to Tottenham...Jus
t don't understand what to do...Shall I watch the next 45 minutes or shall I watch other things happening in tv....Very disappointed ,very saddening to watch....",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Had a great line up on Thursday why the he'll do you keep changing it. Abo out of form should not even make the bench.,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Artete needs to go his formation n tactics r not working at all even emery had a better points tally his ego n arrogance has let him down players r not playing for him at all Arsenal have just become a relegation team we are shambles its either he goes or by end of next week we will be in the bottom three,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Looking forward to this match partey is only positive am seeing here though...,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
this line up fantastic more than playing UCl all the best team Arsenal,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"It's a good line up and I believe it's a3-4-3.
The players cleared the air recently and promised to give their all. Let's win this derby gunners. COYG!",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
We have suffered enough now.....please bring back Ozil....at least he will give 1 or 2 passes for Auba to score....Laca is not a number 10,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
If Arsenal plays exceedingly well then they would marginally come short with a 1-0 defeat otherwise an embarrassment on the cards.For them to go out there and get even a single point is way beyond imagination.,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"We have to win this game today, no excuses get stuck in and have a right go at them",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Are Xhaka and Willian threatening Arteta‚Äôs family unless he plays them? What is he seeing that nobody else in the world seems to be? Literally play ANYONE else apart from those two - Ceballos or Elneny (I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying his name either) in place of Xhaka, and Nelson in place of Willian.",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
I am giving up on this team. So much fanfares but in the end lost games time and again. Haiz...... hopeless.,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Nelson not even on the bench. He is so much better than Willock imho. Other than that I am happy with the line-up.,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Elneny should have started ahead of Xhaka! Elneny and Partey have good understanding.,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Xhaka is leading the league in backward passes completed with almost 70% of his passes going to Gabriel....0 progressive passes from the lad,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"this is a make or break match guys, White Hart Lane with fans are gonna be unforgiving, pundits have written us off and our form isn't doing much to plead a case. We Must Attack, We Must Find the Target and We Must Win",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"The line up is very good though the players have to put all efforts and improvise,play more attacking.",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"We should just support, we don't need any criticism on the team selection, if you want to critisize, get out of here and go to the loo! COYG",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
I swear as much as a try to stay positive about our team I find it hard sometimes specially when MA insists on playing the likes of Willian and Xhaka.... Expecting a bathering tonight and hopefully Arteta to be sacked by Monday,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Very disappointed with the arsenal For a while I didn't watch it and I hated it and lost the game and later they said it was Arteta's responsibility,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"This is what I believe is the best team we have right now, in terms of form. Willian gotta prove his worth and supply to Auba. They have to learn to click to make this work. Laca will get the off chance goal. Go Gunners. Am rooting for ya!",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Why are you even paying 70% of these players? To train full time and play games with no urgency? Get the youth involved at least they play with heart and determination,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
He is very heavy player tonight. Am afraid he he makes so much dribbling and once he loses the ball he cannot recover. We are so lethargic. I guess our time is up and the team needs freshness,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Not sure how Willian keeps getting in the team,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
we need to go to relegation zone there when we shall realize our mistake forward,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Reiss Nelson was supposed to start over Willian... Willian hasn't been good enough for us he was a good player at Chelsea,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Why Holding? Instead i will have Maitland Niles over there in front of Bellerin. The selection is not that bad tho. Lets see how it goes,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Hoping for a good result this evening, hope it will be disappointing as always because a defeat is taking us to relegation tonight",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Please advice Holding not to back Trac to our box let him tackle without running back, pulls strikers into positions they like.",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"Happy with the back 4, and Partey, but the rest need to pull there finger out!",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
How Bellerin gets a game is beyond me caught out constantly and no longer has the pace to recover shocking rightback,108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
Please don‚Äôt lose to the 2nd smallest club in London (after Chelsea),108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"I'm sure of a win here
I don't understand why will be starting wilock ahead other senior players in the team

One of the causes if Emmy downfall

Pls arteta it is only when there is no option u start Wilock

Pls",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2
"I am very proud and happy for this squad, but try to partner Gabridl with Pablo Mari,, again you need to try #9 as attacking midfield and Luiz as DM, not today but at least one day, all the best gunners for life, God bless all the fans and all the players plus the coaching staffs",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2

There's no passion or leadership in this arsenal team..
We will be paying teams like Cardiff, Sheffield Wednesday and Bristol City in the championship if this continues..",108,Spurs,Arsenal,Away,2

"Good Line up!!

I like DeGea but I‚Äôm very happy to see Henderson between the post.

Happy that Edi Cavani is starting for a second time in a row in a short turnaround. Prob the first time since he arrived in Manchester United which is good to see.

Leeds beating Man City is huge for us. WE must WIN this game!

"For Ole and his boys to be second above Leicester, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham, etc, in a season like this, they have done just too great.
When some fans keep insulting them, I just laugh at them. We face Spurs today and because we were 6:1 down in the first leg, we keep insulting our own. Even great managers with better squads can concede goals on a bad day.

Every team has struggled but we're still above. Isn't that fine? Oh, you wanted Utd to win the league. Did you ever think about it after the summer and when league started? Let's appreciate our own oo. There's no Mr Perfect coach anywhere.",308,Spurs,Man Utd,Away,-2
Three world best players in the world. Stop the comparison and enjoy,308,Spurs,Man Utd,Away,-2
"4_4_2 formation good one.

Let's collect the midfield from them.",308,Spurs,Man Utd,Away,-2
We don't need any revenge today. We don't want any. The best revenge is going on a long winning run after the 6-1 and being far above the loud-mouthed clown on the log. The fact that the overrated Jose is languishing in midtable indicates that the 6-1 was a fluke. We are very okay with that. I'm personally glad that whatever happens today will not shake us. It's the fake Special One who is desperate for a result because of his midtable misery which threatens his job.,308,Spurs,Man Utd,Away,-2

We would have the best keepers in we can keep both but knowing De Gea and knowing the ambitions and determination of Henderson, only one can be number one and looks like it is going to be Henderson.

Great choice for the future and will get plenty of years out of him.",308,Spurs,Man Utd,Away,-2

"This referee don spoil our game, what a beautiful goal from cavani yet he cancelled it, Rashford that was punched in the 18 yard box referee didn't do anything, they didn't even check Var, now the same thing has happened to Song and the are checking Var, this game winner has been chosen even before it started.",308,Spurs,Man Utd,Away,-2

So glad Willian is playing in his best position in this game....... The bench üèÉ,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
That's great. I think this man Martineli has restored back. confidence to the Gunners so give him time to rest. We must give him time.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
So long Luiz and William is on the bench Arsenal has a chance of winning!!! Let's make it 3 out of 3 wins.... Boys because I can smell 11th place in the league... Start the year strong and positive!!!,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Guys the lineup is superb! Didnt you see how mo was loosing posetion in the two previous games he almost costed us atleast ceballos can hold the ball for long for smith to get space and auba may make good runs today so ceballos is far much better than elneny and martinel as a super sub is a great bomb in store for wba tired defenders the role belongs to guendouzi i watched schalke vs hertha he was superb he scored a clinical goal let arteta swallow his pride and bring Emery's in_law back!,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Happy that laca is back hopefully he can keep scoring and smith Rowe has another blinder..... gutted martinelli doesn‚Äôt start but understand 3 in 10 might be a bit much for someone who gets through the work like he does....might need him later for they spark !!,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Why would this coach change a winning team? Martinelli has offered us since he came back the much needed energy and the going forward. Now we are back with this backward thinking players....,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Arteta is slipping back to his old ways. He has returned to favoring senior squad members in his starting lineup. Based on current form why should Aubameyang start ahead of Martineli? And when will Arteta ever learn that the combination of Ceballos and Xhaka in the midfield never works. Honestly am not optimistic about a good result tonight. I hope am wrong though.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"I can't believe Martinelli isn't starting this match, all because Arteta is afraid to rest Aubameyang. Good luck to the team though, hope this cowardly decision doesn't cost us 3 point. I so much wish to be proved wrong today.",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Am okay with this line up. Saka plays the right wing. That alone gives me joy!,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Nkt
Benching Martinelli is so disastrous

"Arteta should have started to Martinelli instead of Aubameyang. Inconsistent in the line up is wanting. Let me sleep now instead of waiting an embarrassment and disappointment.
Good luck boys",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"So Balogun and Azeez can't make it as Subs. It's so frustrating to see Nketiah, Willock, Luiz and Willian make it to the bench when good academy lads that are way better than them don't find their way in. I'm happy with the lineup though but Ceballos is a worry for me. Elneny breaks play though his passes aren't so accurate. I can't wait for Partey to be back.",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Another +3 points today! Martinelli has just came out from an injury, he has to rest sometimes, and we know Laca too",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
I'm surprised with the lineup actually. Just hope Arteta won't regret his decision benching Martinelli and Elneny,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Pepe, Willock and Willian should be given ‚òï at their bench sides. They should be comfortable at the benches until they realize what they should be doing at Arsenal FC",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
I completely understand resting Martinelli..He has just come from a serious injury..But I hope Arteta wont bench him forever...He seems to have favourites like Nketiah and Willian who score goals...in his dreams...,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
expected this line up. People will say where‚Äôs Martinelli but the guy just came back from a long term injury and he looked jaded against Brighton. Come on you gunners üí™,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Elneny should b playing every minute.....he has bn our best midfielder this season by far,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"I think Martinelli is on the bench because Arteta doesn't want to risk seeing him getting injured again because he just came back from injury.

Let's hope he gets sub on in the second half",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Xhaka - Ceballos combination has failed the team several times. Hope it will be different tonight. The coach holds the final decision. All the best !!,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Really love this lineup! Glad to see 4 2 3 1 back as the lineup. Win or lose, we should play the arsenal way. Get em lads!",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Right now Martenelli is in better form than Aubamayang. Arteta still lacking the will to drop Aubamayang. Every player has a downtime and at this time Aubamayang is not at his best. Martenelli shouod start am gutted.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Understand the necessity to give Auba a run in the team to build back some confidence. But it is a real shame to see Martinelli on the bench.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Why should you bench martinelli for auba??
Mko na ushenzi sana.
It's rewarding Experience that has cost us so much",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Why‚Äôs everyone moaning about the line up , martinelli played 2 games in 6 days can‚Äôt burn him out , now stop moaning and get behind your team COYG",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Why put a versatile martineli on the bench a play auba.. .i pray we don't regret,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Great line up. Must be cautious with Martinelli. He needs rest to avoid injury. We win this game üí™,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Perfect lineup, Gabriel needs to rest and it's a perfect opportunity for Aubameyang to score and earn some confidence. I hope Dani will generate great chances and play great alongside Rowe",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Why can't this coach maintain the winning line up? I feel like we are losing this. How comes martneilli is benched and instead of elneny we have ceballos? Nkt ‚òπÔ∏èanyway all the best,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"The team need to be intentional in desiring to win today. After the 5 nil loss, Big Sam will set up d defense to make it difficult.

Win the game early enough, a 0-0 scoreline at 80' is dangerous. Score one, score two......don't rest, score three then you can balance the game out till final whistle",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Tactical! We may not need Elneny in the first half. Westbrom will sit back in the first half and allow us come at them. We must push forward with so much power, pace and creativity. We must do all we can to breach their solid defence in the first half. Best of luck guys",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Disappointed to see Martinelli on the bench... His energy and runs will be missed. Hope Arteta doesn't revert to his losing team in the coming games. #COYG üí™,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
I think leaving Martinelli on the bench is a good idea. He'll stretch their defense in the last 20-30 minutes of the game which is what we need against a team like West Brom. Glad to see ESR in the starting lineup again too.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Arteta going back to Auba on the wing? Lacazette does deserve his start and I think having Saka and ESR still brings that youthful exuberance to our lineup which has beared fruits the past 2 games.

#COYG",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Happy with this. Martinelli given a rest I'm happy that Arteta is being cautious with him after the long injury lay off.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Great, Martineli needed in the team but he surely needs a breather as he is coming from an injury. Elneny for Ceballos, I hope he has a good game",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"All we want is just the 3 points
West Brom shouldn't give us much problem but they will go all defense,
I hope the team has enough creativity to unlock the defense in Cabellos
#coyg",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Perfect line up, to play 3 games in 10 days would be a lot to take for Martinelli, he deserves this rest. And Elneny is way too sloppy, but at the same time Xhaka as the holding midfielder frightens me. #COYG",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Everyone stop crying about Martinelli, he came back after a long injury we have to rotate the squad, would you prefer William instead of auba, Auba has been the top most performing player of last two season, he is off form doesn't mean he shouldn't be playing, #COYG",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Nice one, William can also have a chance in this match.
Bring on martinelli in the second half",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
This man never learns. Why change the winning team? What is Aubameyang going to really do? Martinelli is the reason we are rejuvenated back and he's now on the bench!! Anyways I hope I'm wrong and they do the magic,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Not happy with these changes. Martinelli and Elneny.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
As long as Willian isn‚Äôt playing I‚Äôm fine!,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Gabriel Martinelli needs to start bcuz of the attack lacazette is good to go Aubameyang should step up we Know this team will want to defend but we should be able to unlock,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
The elderly Brazilians on the bench. Great move.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Matinelli should start I‚Äôm fade up of changes every match. Aubameyang is off form he shouldn‚Äôt start ahead of martinelli,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Willian should be warming up around 90mins to play added time,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
How can he drop martinelli. Shocking. If we lose this one Done with this man. Who changes a winning team,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Martinelli needs to start!!!,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Elneny is far much better than the loanee dude from Madrid. Elneny intercepts, blocks, holds and can shoot unlike the lazy Ceballos who loses the ball easily. This is a silly change.",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Good to see he hasn't been tempted to put in the players that have been missing for a couple of weeks ( not mentioning names, but we know who they are) . 2 wins in 2 so why change a winning side. Auba is off form.so let's get behind him and help him. I'll be happy with 1-0 to the Arsenal again if we have to grind it out. COYG üòÅ",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"I will assume that Martinelli is being rested. Other than that I see no other justification for benching him. Am hoping Ceballos provides the creativity which we have been lacking. Otherwise, good XI",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"What we lyk i a win. When u look at the table, that is not the position for big teams like arsenal. We need to change our attitude en game reading. Mr. Arteta we trust u bt da team is fading. Am watching da game right now from uganda bt am seing alot of chanses being wasted. The sharpness of our forwards i still too low.",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Very good line up, Martinelli is fresh from injury don‚Äôt let him play so many games in a roll",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Good lineup. Would of preferred to of seen martineli in there but has looked like he could pick up a knock end of last game. Hopefully he's not needed and can have a rest this match üëç. 2-1 ü§ô,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Arteta should know that you don't change a winning team.He should stick with the boys that whipped Chelsea instead of tinkering with the team all the time. I expect him to keep faith with Martinelli, he's one of our brightest prospect.",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Decent line up. But we need more energy and passion from Auba tonight as a Captain.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"I support martinelli on the bench, wish auba is benched, we still have that spark in young gunners.bring on martinelli to run down the defense in the second half.",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
What i only admire is the depth of our bench. Let's c if we can make it 3 in 3.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"#COYG we can do it.
No mercy tonight.
We only speak one language tonight which is a win.
Auba is the only weak player we have tonight.
Hope he proves himself.",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
What part of ¬´ we don‚Äôt change a winning team ¬´ that Arteta doesn‚Äôt understand ?,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Willian and David Luiz are like covid19 virus in the team. Please get rid of them!,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Arteta annoys sometimes. Why keep martinelli on the bench with the kind of energy he puts in a game.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Sad that Martinelli is not in the starting lineup. But i hope the reasoning is because he‚Äôs returning from injury and need a breather. He played alot of minutes the last couple days. There can be no other reason!!,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"I don't know the reason why Arteta believes in Aubameyang, I prefer Martinelli over him for now",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"If we needed to rest martinelli, why didn't Auba start on the bench. I'd rather have Pepe at this point

So frustrating, because we might end up losing with Auba's lack of ambition üò§üò§üò§",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"It's no need now for us to brag an underperforming
team but it's a great win I think we or growing into a better team from the last three games more performance like this an we are in the title race possession now let's not be complacement in our performance but built on it vintage gunners Arsenal fi life",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Makes sense giving martinelli a little break, so many games recently and he‚Äôs had a massive injury!",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Good luck lads. Auba needs to up his game honestly...if that contract thing made him goal shy then we could revise it and see what happens! Martinelli can still come in hot as a sub.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Yeah Smith Rowe....his really getting us move in the creative midfield,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"why matinelli out, why start a losing team which cost us up to where we are right now, Arteta please bring back the winning team",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"I'm very happy and much hopeful for the lineup. Good luck for the team. I also wish Auba a new yr of prosperity, he is good but just need to put more effort and everything will work well for him.",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
I want Arteta to show the same faith in Pepe as he is doing with Auba. Partiality is not a attribute of a good coach.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Laca and Auba can‚Äôt play together. Reiss Nelson must be dead because he can‚Äôt make the bench and Pepe does. Auba on the left won‚Äôt do anything. He couldn‚Äôt out run my Nan in the last few games. Auba looks like he is getting old. Let‚Äôs see by half time if I‚Äôm wrong. Don‚Äôt fear Willian will come to the rescue.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Not a bad line up. Some good sub options as well! We hope for the best.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"Elneny is too lucky to have found a spot in this Arsenal squad...Pepe, Willian and your brother Luiz please find something to keep you busy on the bench..maybe come with playing cards next time",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
'STUPIDITY' is when you know that Auba doesn't deserve to start and you still force yourself to believe that he can do great. Artete is it that Auba tips you from his enormous and unjustified wage? I'm begining to loose my cool Arteta! I hate nonsenseüò°üò°üò°,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Muhammad Elneny in the bench? Then the midfield is dead. I don't trust in #Ceballos starting a head of Elneny in the midfield,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Elneny is our engine without Partey he commands presence and very disciplined postion wise with good distribution from deep..Xhaka and Ceballos are not perfect combination but let's see how it goes.todays win hinges only on attitude displayed by the available forces..Saka starting is a plus,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Actually cant wait till ozil leaves and takes all the muppets who love him so much with him least then this page will be arsenal fans talking about arsenal playing well,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4

Hi. Bellerin in and Martinelli out. What a joke. Arteta forgot already what Tierney and Martinelli was doing on the left wing against Chelsea. We are playing against Sam Allardyce a perfect tactician....,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"West brom are going to sit so deep and compact no need for martinelli to start.
Wait until 70 mins when they getting tired and then bring him on makes sense.
This is a sam alladyce team fighting relagation they are not going against arsenal coming out and playing football and leaving space in behind.
Certainly not from the start anyways.",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"I like the starting 11, Martinelli needs a break, Lacca and Auba will show us the way tonight. And Danny in the middle will mean we should get forward quicker. I'm feeing confident",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
Bring Martinelli and Nketiah on for aubameyang and lacazette does not sound a bad option to have on the bench.,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4
"There is a rather unfamiliar, formerly familiar, face on the bench. I can confidently say we won't be needing him, MA should not have bothered.",170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4

Martinelli is on the bench and Auba is started. Mikel is doing some shamefull tatics!,170,West Brom,Arsenal,Away,-4

"Situation in Myanmar

Night are not safe anymore with serious violation of Basic Human Rights in Myanmar

1
The military just announced that they invoke article 419 to revoke article 5, 7 and 8 of 2008 constitution (basic human rights protection of the people ). The effects are:

1) they can arrest without warrants;
2) they can search the houses without the presence of the ward administrative officer;
3) they can track people down;
4) they can seek for information from the operators;
5) they can detain people for more than 24 hours.

According to those, they can go in and out every house without any permission or warrent, and they can search everywhere and can arrest everyone.

2

The military released the prisoners yesterday.

The released prisoners tried to poison the apartment water tanks in several townships during night time.

Yesterday Night
Released prisoners throw ""Fire Rings"" and burning in most streets of Tharkayta, Yangon around 8:30PM.

3
Tonight the prisoners were putting poison in the drinking water pipes of apartments in NgaMoeYeik Township.

Myanmar people have to build barriers around the streets or wards to protest themselves from the criminals released from prisons by the military. Local people arrest them and ask the prisons about who order them to do it.

-Greenwood. In my opinion, Martial should rotate with Cavani, playing in the middle. But the problem with that is Martial needs to start a few games in a row to get himself into form.

Joel can do a job on the wide midfield role as can Fraser but surely Carrol or Gayle can offer more upfront. I think Murphy is unlucky to not be right wing and Fraser on left with one of the strikers, not Joel up front. Would be way more balanced. Just my opinion but seems each week the team is basically badly structured.",269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Looks like a team set up trying not to lose rather than trying to win I don't know why they again are expecting Joelinton todo anything up front on his own at least Gayle runs around a bit master tactics again. üôÑ,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Why Linton for I would rather play Carrol at least he gives 100%. I can see today been doom and gloom üòûüòûüòû,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0

nce bad. Joe Linton will never score if he doesn‚Äôt shoot instead of passing. TBF one of his better games though.",269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
"Agree it is a poor line up but can‚Äôt agree with the calls for Carroll to play. To me he has offered nothing startling since his return. Maybe not playing to his strengths. Happy to be proved wrong.

To me Ritchie always shows some heart and desire to win so disappointing he is not involved from the start, same with Murphy.

Hendrick, sorry, just an average player.",269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
"It's almost like this monkey wants us to be relegated - how do you play 4 central midfielders across the midfield, well 3 as you can't really include Hendrik. No Gayle or Carrol and he continues to play Jokelinton.",269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
"That is absolutely shocking, look at the players he has left on the bench. Asking to get beat, and will do.",269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
"Why aren‚Äôt we set up for attack? Get hendrick and Joelinton out of that starting lineup and replace them with Murphy and Carroll or Gayle. If Manquillo was fitter he‚Äôd also be replacing Kraft.

The only positive is Dummet replacing Lewis

How many times does he have to play Joelinton as a striker to realise he‚Äôs not one. Anyway... come on lads!,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
How does Hendrick get a game for Newcastle joelinton doesn't score goals wonder where the goals are coming today. It's a game we cant lose to fs. Murphy should be starting played well when he came on the last game and has pace not line that lineup starting fs,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0

Not a team you‚Äôd wanna put out for a relegation scrap - most of those players are on the bench.",269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Clearly he has learned nothing for the Sheffield Utd game!! Terrified of loosing so set up not to get beat again rather than going for the win. 4 attack minded players on the bench and he brings in Hendrick and continues with Joelinton!! Who is going to get us a goal?? Negative approach again but no doubt the blame will lie anywhere and everywhere but at his door.,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0

Bruce obviously under the thumb with the powers that be re Joelinton. No other explanation as to why he plays him rather than Gayle or Carroll. #Bruceout,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
be a miracle if we win with linton and hendrick what has gayle got to do to get a game bloody shocking,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Bruce says hes a fan but is playing a lineup EVERY fan doesnt want! I was hopeful of gayle and carroll starting today...this is grim,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
"Hendrick, Hayden and Shelvey are all sluggish in the middle. You need Shelvey though!

"Bruce defo trying to get the sack. Attacking players like Murphy, Gayle and Carroll on the bench as well as Ritchie. Hayden, Shelvey and Hendrick in midfield is just so defensive. Not a very positive line up for me. Well off to my Hot Tub to chill before the game now.",269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Then he wonders why we get annoyed? No striker picked.... again. Just a guy with 3 goals in nearly 60 games and about 5 good games in total. Meanwhile a lad with 5 in 30 gets left out again. Bruce logic.,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Maybe it‚Äôs a precaution but we are much better with manquillo in the team.,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
We will win today... Anyone who thinks gayle and Carroll are a better option than Joelinton don't watch enough football.... At least Joelinton can link play and hold the ball up... The other 2 offer nothing.... None of them are good enough in fairness,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0

Worst line up I could think of and how is jokelinton and Hendrick in there ahead of Carroll and Gayle~ also why‚Äôve we only got one winger again... üòÇ,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Hendrick and joelinton FFS both bring nothing to the team absolute joke Richie and Gayle or Carroll should of started only good change dummett for Lewis,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Well boys let's get ready for the championship. That lineup is horrific,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
How does J Linton get to start up top ahead of Carrol and Gayle. His stats over last 18 months and hold up play prove he is unable to help the Team when we really need it. Let‚Äôs hope I am wrong! Hendrick in to strengthen up RHS. Willock or Hayden supporting through the middle. Bruce‚Äôs last throw of the dice. Fail today and owner must react.

Why no Carroll? He‚Äôs our only hope,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Thought Ritchie might have made the starting XI üòÇüòÇüòÇ,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Line up putting us on the back foot from the off! Zero pace in final 3rd and Fraser has been hide and seek champion when he plays. They will be well up for it and whilst not spectacular they have players in final 3rd that can hurt us. With that line up I can only see defeat. I really do hope I am wrong,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0

Great. What a line up. I have much optimism for this match. Joelinton will score 6. FFS!,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
I get the feeling that Bruce couldn‚Äôt give a xxxx whether we win or not with this line up. Except for the first couple of game Hendrick has done nothing. A blind man knows that Joelinton is not a striker and at best should be on the wing. Fernandez and Manquillo are on the bench while Krafth is startingüò©,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
Even my 7 yr old has asked what formation are they playing. He also said that either gayle or carroll should be playing as Joe from Linton is useless.,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0
playing willock as front 3 wide right is strange you get the best of him playing in midfield as an attacker. joelinton down the middle ! absaloutle waste of time. and Hendrick back in the team ! what have the likes of gayle and richie got to do to get in the team. I would of played fraser gayle and Murphy as a front 3. good to see dummet back though.,269,West Brom,Newcastle,Away,0

O decision makers, leaders of the humans and their people altogether in various regions, I exhort you only to one thing that you rise-up forGod‚Äôs sake by twos and singly, then ponder who is the one that God fulfilled to him the challenge with Truth upon the actual reality in regard to what they call it coronavirus? Is it the challenge of the human physicians or the challenge of the Awaited Mahdi servant of God and His khalifa the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni?

That‚Äôs in order for you to know the sure knowledge that by no means and they can never encompass knowledge from Allah except by what He pleases; glory be to Him above what you associate (with Him) and apostate because of what you have from modern science have deceived and (Allah) encompassed you with what the ancient ones did not have, then what you have from science of the technical data and the knowledge in various fields have deceived you, for that (Allah) challenged you by what you do not encompass knowledge and from the tiniest soldiers of Allah until He made your data zero on the left (has no value) O community of whom they rejoiced with what they have of knowledge and they thought that they indeed have power over everything then Allah insulted your ability and humiliated your arrogance and removed your conceitedness by the smallest soldier from His creation; not seen by the naked eye for its small size and that‚Äôs in order for you to know the worth of yourselves, as well in order for you to know the sure knowledge that Allah‚Äôs chastisement; the strangling disease of what you call it coronavirus that could never remove it from you other than Allah, Him Alone. Verily, they must repent from the major sins, indecencies, oppressing people and the wrongfulness of association, and to say: ‚ÄúOur Lord, we have wronged ourselves, if You do not forgive us and (not) have mercy on us we certainly would be of the losers‚Äù. And after the repent let them say: ‚ÄúOh Allah, I am Your servant, I ask you by the fact there is no God except You, and by the fact of Your mercy that You ordained upon YourSelf, and by the fact of greatness of the Bliss of YourSelf‚Äôs good-pleasure that is greater than the bliss of Your heavenly-garden
that you heal me from the chastisement of corona or remove it away from me surely I believe in the true caller from You. Oh Allah, remove Your chastisement away from us and from every entrance so we would follow the path of Truth from You, and to make us steadfast on fulfilling what we promised You ‚Äî O Who comes between man and his heart, surely we do not have except Your mercy that You ordained upon YourSelf. Indeed, if You do not forgive us and (not) have mercy on us we would surely be of the losers. Oh our Allah, You have said in Your decisive Book: {And your Lord says: Pray to Me, I will answer you.}Truthful Allah the Great [Gh√£fer] 40:60, so from me is the supplication and turning (close) yet from You is to responding, indeed you You never violate Your promise, our Lord, glory be to You, Surely Your promise is ever True and You are the Most Merciful than all who have mercy. O our Allah, make us steadfast upon fulfilling what we promised You to follow Allah‚Äôs global caller khalifa of Allah in the land; the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni. O our Allah, make sending him as favor on us and not affliction against us because we turned away from his true call (to Allah); for the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni‚Äù.

"The 5 poits of Challenge from God through Coronavirus
üåπüá¨üáßüëáüá¨üáßüå∑üá¨üáßüëáüá¨üáßüåπ
It is a must that you make the decision makers in various countries of the humans to gain knowledge over the global challenge of the explanatory-sta
tement in which we wrote it on the date, tenth of Rajab 1441 (05/3/
2020) by the title ‚ÄúCorona-virus is from the minor chastisement before the major chastisement so they may turn (to Allah)‚Äù then they look at points of the challenge with truth in that old explanatory-statement on the date, Rajab ten 1441, and we had put in that old explanatory-sta
tement points of the challenge that we summarize it as follows:

1- It is a global chastisement from Allah and not a mere global disease.

2- Indeed, the entire human physicians by no means and they could never be able to know how coronavirus is formed.

3- Verily, the entire human physicians by no means and they could never be able to control it, how can they control chastisement of Allah, glory be to Him?

4- Surely, the entire human physicians the Muslim and the disbeliever of them by no means and they could never be able to find treatment or vaccine for it, even if they were backing up each other.

5- Certainly, they will find from the cunning of what they call it coronavirus what they did not expect.

This explanatory-sta
tement in which we mentioned challenging points was issued by the date Rajab ten, while what they call it coronavirus did not yet invade except china and Iran, as for countries of the whole world it shook them a great shake before it came to them and invade them. The question that comes up: is it truly that Allah ratified His servant and khalifa of His by the challenge with truth upon the actual reality? That‚Äôs in order for the entire decision makers in the entire countries of humans and their people to know that we are indeed truthful, and that the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni truly knows from Allah what they entire humans did not know for the fact Allah granted him knowledge of the Book the grand Quran. O community of the worlds, I am not a madman to announce points of the challenge before this helplessness of yours randomly out of myself, far from, very far.. Indeed, by Lord of the earth and heavens, I know that in Allah‚Äôs Book the grand Quran, and I only name it with what you call it coronavirus for the word search in the world wide internet.

I announce to the whole world signs of chastisements coming by air, land and sea in addition to what would be provided more to you from chastisement of coronavirus until they humble (themselves) to Allah‚Äôs khalifa the selected Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni and submit fully, have we made a condition that scholars of the Muslims among the worlds and all the diputers about religion of all the people but to accept Allah as a Judge between them in all what they differed therein about their religion? And the only duty of Allah‚Äôs khalifa the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni is to deduce to them Allah‚Äôs judgement about an issue from Allah‚Äôs decisive Book the grand Quran, then they were haughty upon Allah‚Äôs khalifa and His Book the grand Quran that they turned away from following it and leave what is contrary to it, while I call them and the worlds since fifteen years ago yet they turn away and were haughty upon Allah‚Äôs khalifa until Allah got angry for His Book, and they would never find a way out from Allah‚Äôs chastisement except by repenting to Allah and draw near to guide their hearts in order for them to follow the true caller from their Lord Allah‚Äôs khalifa in the land and His servant; the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni and they submit full, and peace be upon the messengers, and praise be to Allah Lord of the worlds

Good luck Brighton... Percy Tau team.,149,West Ham,Brighton,Away,0
Very strong line up. Disappointed not to see Cedric at right back. Confident of a second derby win in a week! GOYG,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"We're playing utter dog shite Leno calls himself our no1 goalie, I say bring back Martinez. We are being outplayed everywhere even Partey in midfield seems half asleep. F***ING wake up & start playing like you wanna win this game. Be more precise with the passing would be a start",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"This was a good game to bombard all good players like featuring Cedric, Gabriel and Emily Smith Lowe,,,
Cedric for Chambers and Gabriel for Luiz and Smith for Saka is not in good form,, must be exhausted need some rest.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
ü§ß or üçø.... bring us üçø üòÇüòÇ nah come on boys üí™üèæüí™üèæ 3 points for the fans. Up the Gunners family üíØ,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Very strong line up.......Let's clinch our second derby win in less than one week.

Zhaka needs to have some rest,because he has featured in 17 consecutive games for Arsenal and he hasn't missed every minute.

He has been our best player so far.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Super strong lineup. Glad to see Chambers back in action. Hope he steps up today. Arteta showing intent with such an attacking lineup. Let‚Äôs not be wasteful tonight üëäüèæüí™üèΩ,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"I dont get Mikel well sometimes.....W
hat is wrong with Rob? Cedric is preferred at the RB. And if he knows he is not going to Sign Odegaard permanently, I don't see why he should be starting matches ahead of EsR. Though he is in no doubt very good.All the best guys",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Good lineup, but that can't make me forget we are Arsenal who give easy time for the opponents to score. High time we talk of consistency.

Good luck boys",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Arteta is experimenting on every players in each games!

Let's see what this line up can give us!",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Smith Rowe and martinelli on the bench is a grave mistake. They should have started, instead of auba and Laca respectively ü§îü§îü§îbut any way we are Arsenal and winning is our business",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"We should work on this culture of conceding early and chasing the game after. Imagine if it was a very good team.We would have lost the game easily on the day.Our defense still need a lot to be done,we also need a third strong defensive midfielder. We concede too early and that's not good enough.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Chambers for what????? Very slagish, and very poor offensively.
That one weak point will disorganize the team, and sadly we will loose",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Very nice line up, but I would prefer to pepe to start the match. He had been one of the most consistent player. Let‚Äôs make London red again, we have to win",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Good selection but I really think we need to give Martinelli more game time and starts! He terrorises defences with his speed. He's a real threat and like Emile, he just needs a run in the team to prove himself!",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Cedric should've start at right back.. these is physical game so we need physical players to start,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Cedric for Chambers and I'd be happy. Not sure chambers has the ability to push forward but maybe arteta isn't planning on bombing forward down the right. Let's put some belief into the line up. COYG!,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Arteta is joking,why not include Cedric Soares,we need to win every single game from now henceforth till end of the season but chambers is weak link in this team",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Very good line up but we shoukd be weary of the hammers,
They are inform which is why they are into top 5
Good luck guys
#coyg",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"We really need a consistent center-back partnership, we can not keep tinkering the defense all the time, winning teams don't do this..",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"√òdegaard is the finest representation of a modern day ‚ÄúPure‚Äù #10. Not only is he classy with elite vision, but he also works his socks off the whole game. A special player.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
What's Cedric doing on the bench... He's been the better of all our RBs... Apart from that we're good to go,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Very strong forward line; capable of breaking down tight defences. But why starting with chambers instead of Cedric.... Westham 2:3 Arsenal. we are winning.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Think Cedric should start instead of chambers as more of an attacking threat and chambers hasn‚Äôt had enough game time to come into a game like this, he looked rusty on his last outing",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"sloppy play cost us the match at Olympiacos and we were fortunate to have maintained the advantage, this time around we need to be on the ball, no mistakes, no lapses in thought and no squandering chances, win the match, climb the table, with a win we'll be 2 points off of Liverpool,4 points off of West Ham and 6 off of Chelsea, close the gap guys and finish as high as we can",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
The opening 20 mins we have been so poor I even said after they scored if we aren‚Äôt careful this could be over before half time we just haven‚Äôt got going I‚Äôm expecting an improvement but I‚Äôm doubtful so so poor defensively and absolutely non existent up front shambles all over,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Xhaka is so far the strongest player we have. He hardly get injured and play every games. Luiz had been strong too. Just that this guys aint consistent in bettering their games.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Arteta showing great decision making to play Chambers who runs like he is stuck in treacle, against quick players. Proven that he can‚Äôt play RB so let‚Äôs do it in an important game üëçüèΩ",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
What the Cedric doing on the bench. Chamb√©rs don't deserve to start todayü§îArteta seems he playing Lotto. that he don't know what will happen.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Chambers has finished this beautiful line up, he doesn't even know when he drift down to CB most times.. CEDRIC would have been better",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"What sort of Gamble is this? Why Chambers and if he must play, why starting him ahead of Cedric?
I'm not comfortable with Luiz and Mari partnership. They're slow... I'm just scared of Antonio's pace and strength. Gabriel would have been better.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"I think putting on chambers for Cedric is tectical. Chambers is a right central defender this means Saka will be a winger and won't really have to deal with defensive duties. The Hammers are weak in the central part of the fields and we need to dominate that area to win.
Let go bozy.... Another win for #Gunners",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Must fans always criticize a lineup? If you're this good at coaching, please apply. We have a bench. Great game ahead.
COYG.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Arteta out!!!! This guy is becoming the next lampard, arsenal is too big for him, how can he change the whole defence?",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Pepe never plays. He got 5 games or so middle season, played very well and since he hasn‚Äôt been seen ...",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Wonder why right back is Chambers. Should rest Luiz and start ESR over Auba.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Nice line up except Chambers at right back, Cedric is better making overlap to assist saka,it will be another quiet game for saka,aside that,good line up for me...bring back the 3point ...we move",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"I can understand why chambers is starting to give us some presence aerially. But should we always change our team to counter the opponents threat or play to our strength and have them adjust to our threat instead.

Thats an average team mentality. You dont see mancity or liverpool or barcelona do that. This shows howfar down our beloved arsena have fallen.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Arteta has failed to find a consistent team. Always changing and destabilizing the squad..If you play well today, next time he puts you on the bench!!",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"ESR? Should be starter always. I see only 3 players irreplaceable: Sakha, Tierney and ESR...",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Don't come back to Emirates if you don't win today üòíüòíüòí

Just stay and adopt London stadium as your home ground till the day you win LEAGUE.

By the way, why is Ozil and Monreal not playing for months now, are they not back from injury yet??üòíüòí",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Arteta just had to bench Cedric for chambers, its okay!!!!
That's the highway to goals",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"I would have preferred Martinelli ahead of Auba and Cedric ahead of Chambers to be honest. Gabi needs more game time, he is wasted on the bench!",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Auba out and Martineli should be in!!,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Good that willian never made it to the bench for today.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Cedric should have started. He was in fine forms when beating Tottenham,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Why Auba again and again? Why all this support to him from Arteta? Auba is awful Martinelli deserves the chance,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Different starting 11 for every game. This will make the opponent confused. Genius arteta,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Good lineup but Cedric should have started, that guy is immense as a right back",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Come on what‚Äôs Martinelli gotta do to get a game,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
When the bench looks stronger than the team,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Can't remember the last time Arsenal had a full squad to pick from by this time of the season...massiv
e improvement from the medical team...let's take it into next season...#COYG",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"What a joke with the way we aren't playing. In fact, you wonder if we have even bothered to turn up. Can't wait till the end of this season!!",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"For me why keeping Cedric...Chambe
rs should come from the bench.... Good lineup though",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Arteta couldn't change the club. Even things are getting worse and worse by him than the previous. nothing different this year as well last year. worse position ever in Arsenal history after he's management . What we are keeping ? No Aub last night,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
We ceased to be a big team courtesy of some green manager!! I repeat the manager must go!!,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"A strong team. If we won't beat West Ham easily then we have reduced ourselves to a mid table team. 3 points loading. But, this David Luiz, is he an assistant coach helping Arteta on the pitch?",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Poor line up. I wish we could truly give Rob Holding a chance to continue doing what he had been doing. We are really leaking in this Luiz line up,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"No Chambers. Cedric please! Chambers needs time to fill the gap between him and the team. Use him in an ""easy"" game, if there are easy games in Premier League...",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Mr Arteta, Cedric should have been preferred to Chambers a good coach deploys his players in the right positions Chambers is not good in that position bcoz his offensive part is not good.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"How is aubameyang in the side, he hes been terrible this season, give martinelli a game surely he cant be any worse.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
I feel Lingard has been a threat ahainst arsenal since he was at Manchester he's a man to watch,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Come on where?ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£these are the hammers you will be hammered until you tell us the importance of letter 'k' in the word knife.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"God!! Which kind of coach is this, Benching Cedric for Chambers, Martinelli should have start this game ahead of Saka who is just got back injury

Many things is happening üôÑüôÑ I am not watching the game anyways",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Must you continue playing lazy Auba the team performed better last weekend without him anyway arsenal cannot beat westham today,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Didn't they blow a 3 goal lead yesterday? ""Morning Joe"" has a spot on Monday with a Brit named Roger Bennett, where they cover English League soccer. He's hilarious! He also hosts a show called ""Men In Blazers"".",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
What is Auba doing on the pitch? He couldn't care less about playing football right now.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Good line up come on Gunners bring the 3pts home,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"This Arteta I don't understand u sometimes, what exactly is Chambers doing in this line up, somebody who has not featured well this season is now coming to play against a strong side like westham...Hones
tly ur decisions baffles me sometimes...eac
h match u keep changing our back four....",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
For the umpteenth time am saying this.... Arsenal as a team doesn't have a Target or purpose for any game. They play every game with lack of urgency and philosophy. The board of Directors should read out the riot act to the Manager and the entire team. This lackadaisical attitude and approach towards crucial matches must not be condoned any longer,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"I think the tinkering with our starting lineup is tooo much, that's our biggest problem this season. We need a starting line up that will gel and give us constant results.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Balanced selection. Let's get the 3 points.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Sun Auba on 60 of he doesn‚Äôt show up! Should be on the bench,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Hope Saks's hamstring holds up He's been brilliant all season and will be a big loss if he's out for a long time.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Leno

Cedric Luiz Gabriel Tierney

Partey Xhaka

Saka Odegaard Smith

Lacazette

If Arteta was the boss who was in charge of the team he would have opted this lineup. The one he chose shows the player power within the group. He is trying to make the players happy more than the team to win. üò∑",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
What a load of garbage arteta is such an average manager with such an average team,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Very strong lineup but I think Saka should rest a bit so he can fully recover.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Gud line up ... Chance for pepe and mrtnell to an end "" rest ESR was good opinion by arteta so far",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Mikel Arteta I think he has a problem. Why keep rotating the team?? Gabriel Magalh√£es, Nico Pepe and Cedric needs playing time. I don't know why he plays the error prone David Luiz?????",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Poor team selection. We didn't learn anything from the Europa league loss or the north London derby win.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
I feel Arteta is experimenting with our darling club. I have my eyes on Chambers though. A coach that doesn't know his best eleven players.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Its safe to say that I don't think arteta rated martinelli highly. Which is sad as many arsenal fans including myself really like martinelli. He had a a great attitude in the pitch whenever he plays.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
This should yield 3 points! Unless its one of those days we decide to just make things unnecessarily difficult for ourselves !!,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
But why is arteta changing our backline game by game.....this seems to be causing inconsistency and failure to get a perfect starting eleven.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Very impressive display from √òdegaard today! We should start trying to make the deal permanent before he drives up his value even more.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Great selection let's hope it is strong enough to win guys don't keep playing out of the back mix it up,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
I feel Auba shouldn't be in that wing position. It should be Martinelli. Auba shld be benched. Seems Arteta can't do without him there. Relying too much on Auba has brought us to where we are now. Am also concerned about Chambers. His crosses are poor compared to Cedric. But Arsenal all the way,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
I probably would have had Cedric and Holding in the line up but let's go boys. Get behind the team. C'mon you Gunners,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0

Why are The Arsenal's best 2 centre backs on the bench and we have to put up with watching sideshow Bob and why does xhaka keep getting game time it's beyond me same old mistakes made by the manager week in week out the blokes clueless,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Instead of Cedric you are using Chambers is alright is like you want to loss again, westham is a good side and we don't have to gamble this game with people like Chambers.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Since Chambers Came back he has played twice yet Martinelli needs to be patient. Arteta doesnt Love the guy.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"This nonsense from Arteta et Al is very annoying...
Every game is an obvious experiment by this hopeless coach....
Does he want to put Chambers up for sale by advertising the flop?
This pairing of Luiz and Mari is just too awful....

Fuseki man...",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Would of liked Cedric in starting line up. Deserves to be there,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
What is Chambers doing in there? There is no much time now for a player to improve on games. Get cedric in there.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
This team is rubbish. What an absolute joke of en effort. Getting run around the pitch like primary school boys,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
The lineup is not the problem guys. Our mentality is. I hope we don't shoot ourselves in the leg ü¶µ as we use to. Good luck guys.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0

"A very good lineup. Chambers preferred to give us stability at RB and the presence aerially to out muscle Michael who will keep drifting away to right side of our defense.

Why is Martenelli always on the bench,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Why is Arteta ever changing team. Someone who plays better is always benched. Gabriel, Sedric and Smith on the benchüò£üò£üò£",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Gutted Martinelli hasn't got in the lineup after his good cameo the other night. He deserves his chance more than some others in that lineup for sure.,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Guys Chambers not the problem HERE!! THE Problem is not Starting Martinelli for Saka... The Boy needs to rest his an important player... Furthermore Great Lineup. Xhaka & Partley better perform today... Good luck GUNNERS,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Chambers is my main concern at the back..so slow and offering little going forward... Great to see saka back though,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Frequently changing of defenders is really costing us,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Aubameyang is not young anymore and should not be played in the wings. If you wont play in as a centre forward then he should be benched.

Chambers is not meant to replace cedric. Forget the Aeriel things you people are talking about. If he cant make the right runs and assist then it's also a minus.

Arteta needs to find the best centre back partnerships for top games.

Martinelli and Smith Rowe are very good in high pressing.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Was kind of hoping holding would be in over Luiz but still a strong side !,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Still not performing as they should be,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
One of the reasons why we are not consistent is coz we change line up and formation almost every game,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Like seriously i don‚Äôt understand Arteta
Is that how we will continue without having stable first eleven?
Now Cedric have prove his self continue using him so that he can get his best form.
He did the same thing with Lacazette when Lacazette was pick his form he started bench him.
To me i don‚Äôt understand Arteta.",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Better performance 2nd half agree with Jamie Cara that Chambers man of the match,290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
"Arteta has killed the midfield,he should have started with Smith to help in mid instead of Auba",290,West Ham,Arsenal,Away,0
Bruce‚Äôs rules please note all players must adhere if you are lucky enough to get to the half way line pass it back to the goal line and all fall back if by accident the ball crosses the half way line into the opponents half give them the ball back as quick as you can then get back in defence and hope they don‚Äôt score if they do then hope at some stage in extra time we can get a set piece and Knick a point to keep us safe howay the lads good job üëç,60,Wolves,Newcastle,Away,0
Still not keen on hendrick... But nice to see miggy and fraser start.. Problem is they have shackles on coz Bruce is too defensive... Scraped a draw awful to watch,60,Wolves,Newcastle,Away,0

"More attacking players which is good but what formation will we play? 3 at the back with Fraser/Murphy at RWB? 4 at the back with Schar at RB? Or as a DM in a 433? Miggy playing deeper with Hendricks? Or 4411 with Schar and Hendrick at CM?

Whatever it is I hope it works",60,Wolves,Newcastle,Away,0
"Set up shouldn't surprise if OL. bruce doesn't start with 8-1-1 üòÉ despite the attacking team sheet.

"Better line up but still question marks on formation and players out of position. Thought Longstaff would have started instead of Hendrick! Can picture Steve‚Äôs patter if we lose 3-0, blame the fans and social media!",60,Wolves,Newcastle,Away,0
Actually looking forward to this match and seeing Wilson and Fraser together,60,Wolves,Newcastle,Away,0
"WTF is that line up all about? 3 centre halfs, one full back (with two on the bench), three wingers? Yet some folk still think that Bruce is the right man?.....",60,Wolves,Newcastle,Away,0
"Ave always stuck up for Bruce a bit...e does do an say some daft things at times...but most managers do....but that team is just weird....unless
Hendrick is the only fully fit centre mid we have...dosnt explain not having a rb... but having 2 on the bench..an all of a sudden putting Murphy...and Almiron in..an Frazer all at same time when e didnt seem to want to play them...just weird.",60,Wolves,Newcastle,Away,0
Hayden is the teams best challenger of the ball. Without him in the middle its a little light weight in there. Looks like the team is set up to attack with pace but that's a massive hole in CM..... hard game but im hoping for summit out of this,60,Wolves,Newcastle,Away,0
"Can't complain with that starting 11 in my opinion

Okay so we are playing a defender as midfielder an attacking winger as right back when we have 2 players on the bench who play both them positions. Out manager is a relic and a clown and can't wait till he's given the boot he deserves.,60,Wolves,Newcastle,Away,0
